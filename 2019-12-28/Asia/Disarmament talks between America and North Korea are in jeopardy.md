STEPHEN BIEGUN sounded like a jilted spouse pleading with an errant partner. North Korea’s recent statements about its relationship with America were “so hostile and negative and so unnecessary”, America’s special envoy lamented in South Korea on December 16th. Mr Biegun was on a last-ditch mission to revive stalled disarmament talks with North Korea, in which the North has said it is no longer interested. Towards the end of his remarks, Mr Biegun directly addressed his North Korean counterparts: “We are here. You know how to reach us.” 
North Korea responded to the envoy’s entreaties with icy silence. This leaves the Korean peninsula in a precarious position as the year draws to a close. Negotiations have faltered ever since a summit between Donald Trump, America’s president, and Kim Jong Un, the North’s dictator, collapsed in February over the two sides’ irreconcilable expectations. America says North Korea must begin disarming before sanctions can be lifted or America’s military footprint in South Korea scaled back in any significant way. North Korea insists it has already taken notable steps towards dismantling its nuclear-weapons and long-range missile programmes, for which it demands some recompense before it will make any further concessions. 
The stalemate could give way to escalation. Though America says it wants to keep talking, the North seems to have decided that it has nothing more to gain from the talks. Following the failure of the summit, which many observers believe Mr Kim found deeply humiliating, the North set a deadline. If the Americans did not become “more flexible” before the end of the year, its negotiators said, it would abandon talks. In October, after a lower-level meeting between the two sides ended in acrimony, North Korea reiterated the threat. It would not return to the table without a “complete and irreversible withdrawal” of America’s “hostile policy”. 
The tough talk has been accompanied by a string of provocations, which have grown more flagrant in recent weeks, along with lots of martial symbolism. North Korea has tested new short-range missiles on 13 occasions since May. In the past month it has conducted two engine tests at a site in Sohae that it had showily dismantled when negotiations first began. Analysts say the tests are consistent with preparations for the launch of a long-range missile, which would end Mr Kim’s self-imposed moratorium on such tests, the basis of Mr Trump’s claim in 2018 that there was “no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea”. 
Mr Kim has also taken two well-publicised trips on horseback up Mount Paektu, the mountain hailed as the birthplace of communism in North Korea, preparing his people for “hard times” and a “new path” ahead. At a plenum of North Korea’s Workers’ Party planned in the next few days, he is expected to describe the path in more detail. Kim In-tae of South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy thinks he may formally renounce the moratorium. “That,” he says, “will demolish any hope of getting assistance from America.” 
Mr Kim may be willing to risk that, since the North does not appear to be in a desperate situation economically. Several regions are in the midst of a construction boom, says Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute in Seoul. Tourism from China has grown into an important source of revenue, bringing in tens of millions of dollars a year by some estimates. Moreover, China and Russia have put forward a resolution at the UN advocating the lifting of some sanctions, including a reversal of the decision to compel all North Koreans working abroad to return home by December 22nd. Russia, which hosts many such workers, claimed the move was aimed at encouraging further talks between America and North Korea. 
North Korea may be imagining that it can force America’s hand with further provocations, says Bob Carlin of Stanford University. “If they think escalation puts pressure on America to make a deal they’re wrong. They’re just backing themselves ever further into a corner.” That leaves a return to the high tensions and aggressive rhetoric that preceded the pivot to diplomacy in early 2018 as the most likely outcome. On December 16th Mr Trump said ominously that America would “take care of” any hostile step by North Korea. ■
