FOR NEARLY three decades Omar al-Bashir’s regime butchered and plundered. Since 2010 the former Sudanese president has evaded an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes and genocide in the Darfur region. In Khartoum his Islamist government would flog women for wearing trousers and kill protesters in the streets. After he was ousted in a coup in April, leaving behind an economy in crisis and a country awash with armed groups, many hoped he would spend the rest of his life behind bars. 
On December 14th a Sudanese court convicted Mr Bashir, aged 75, of money-laundering and corruption after $130m was found in suitcases in his home. But he was sentenced only to two years in a “reform facility” after the court said he was too old to go to prison. One commentator in Sudan said it had, in effect, put him in a nursing home. Residents of Darfur dismissed the verdict as the work of a “political court”, says Mohamed Haggar of the region’s human-rights commission. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a civil-society coalition that spearheaded the protest movement leading to Mr Bashir’s fall, welcomed the ruling but said it was “certainly not the end of the day”. 
In Sudan the task of bringing powerful people to justice is an especially fraught part of a delicate democratic transition. For now, says Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, the interim government appears to be “trying to avoid rocking the boat”. In his verdict the judge noted that Mr Bashir’s regime had in the past executed someone for the same crime. By contrast, institutions including the judiciary have acted with restraint since Mr Bashir’s overthrow, notes Harry Verhoeven, the author of a book on Sudan. Respecting a law that prohibits jailing people over 70 is one sign of this. So is the government’s decision to put Mr Bashir on trial for corruption before dealing with graver charges, such as crimes against humanity. 
The former president will soon find himself in the dock again. He has been charged with ordering the killing of protesters and recently appeared in court over his role in the coup that brought him to power in 1989. Sudan is also pondering whether to hand him over to the ICC in The Hague, as survivors of the genocide in Darfur demand. Abdalla Hamdok, an economist who now leads the government, has signalled that he would like to do so. But Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who heads the 11-member Sovereign Council which oversees the largely civilian administration, has refused. 
The disagreement reflects a tug-of-war between generals and civilians in the transitional government. The civilians think that Sudan’s judiciary is ill equipped for such a complex and expensive case. They also want to mend Sudan’s relations with the wider world, which would be helped by its co-operation with the ICC. But many of the generals would prefer to keep control of the judicial process for fear that, abroad, their former boss might reveal information that would damage them. General Burhan, for instance, is accused of co-ordinating army and militia attacks in Darfur at the height of the conflict in the early 2000s. 
Equally hard will be holding anyone accountable for the slaughter of more than 100 protesters in Khartoum in June by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group. An inquiry set up in September is due to report its findings this month. The RSF’s leader, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), is General Burhan’s deputy on the council and is widely believed to be responsible for the bloodshed. “Everybody knows Hemedti was in it with all his ten fingers,” says a foreign diplomat. But many question the independence of the committee leading the inquiry and expect it will stop short of blaming Mr Dagalo. 
That may be because Mr Dagalo commands about 40,000 armed men and could derail the transition if threatened. “In government there is a preference for stability over divisive, if just, verdicts,” says Mr Horner. For now the old regime’s many victims may have to put up with Mr Bashir spending a few months in a rest home. They will not be satisfied. ■
