THIS IS A year of poignant anniversaries in Spain’s relationship with Latin America. Exactly 500 years ago Hernán Cortés launched his conquest of Mexico. In 1939 Mexico’s left-wing president, Lázaro Cárdenas, opened the door to Spaniards fleeing fascism at the end of the civil war. It might have been a celebratory year for Spanish business, too. In 1989 Telefónica, Spain’s biggest telecoms firm, made its first incursion into Latin America by bidding for a Chilean counterpart, unleashing a flood of Spanish investment into the region in the 1990s known as la reconquista. Instead, it has been a year of pot-banging protests and economic turmoil in the region. It says a lot that 30 years after it planted the flag, Telefónica has decided to cut its losses in the former Spanish colonies, and may sell its businesses there altogether. 
Telefónica’s new strategy, announced late last month, is part of a rethink of the company by its boss, José María Álvarez-Pallete. Its market value has almost halved over the past five years to €35bn ($39bn). It carries a whopping €38bn of net debt. And, common to all global telecoms firms, it faces the challenge of offering customers much faster wireless speeds via 5G and more digital services. As a result it plans to refocus on four core markets, Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, and create separate digital and infrastructure businesses. On December 4th Orange, its French rival, announced similar plans to reinvent itself for the digital age. 
Yet it is the prospect that Telefónica may sell its businesses in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Peru and other so-called Hispano-American countries, that is most significant. They account for 21% of its revenues. Their sale, which could raise €13bn or more, represents a historic U-turn that is likely to reverberate in Spain’s boardrooms. Like Telefónica, Spanish banks, energy firms and other companies have reason to agonise over the slow growth and currency volatility across the Atlantic. Their industries, too, are in the throes of technological disruption. For some Latin America is no longer a land of opportunity, but a distraction. 
For years Spaniards celebrated the revival of their imperial ties to the New World. When Latin American countries started to liberalise their economies in the late 1980s, Spain was a country with a meagre population, inward-looking companies, and a pressing need to globalise. Few Europeans believed that it would fulfil its aim of becoming a bridge to Latin America. However, as Lourdes Casanova of Cornell University recalls, its companies needed quickly to build scale there to resist other European firms breathing down their necks at home. Latin America helped turn Spanish firms into global ones. 
Within a few decades Spain had become the second-biggest foreign investor in the region after America. Its firms have investments today worth €156bn there. The biggest, such as Telefónica, Santander and BBVA in banking, Iberdrola in utilities, and Repsol in oil and gas, accounted for most of Spain’s investment in the region. Their shared language, as well as passable Portuñol in Brazil, enabled them to operate service industries in places where telecommunications, banking and utilities were hopelessly backward. Profits from Latin America during a commodities boom helped Spanish firms through the financial crisis of 2008-09. 
That is only half of the story, though. After underbidding in 1990 for Telmex, the Mexican telecoms monopoly that turned Carlos Slim into one of the world’s richest men, Telefónica went on to overpay elsewhere, sinking over €140bn in the region, a fortune compared with what the assets are worth now. The ride since then has been a rollercoaster. From the tequila crisis in Mexico in 1994-95, through mega-devaluations and political upheaval in Brazil and Argentina, to left-wing dictatorship in Venezuela, Spanish investors have had a crash course in disaster management. Repsol may have suffered the worst. In 2012 Peronists in Argentina—who beat a reformist incumbent in October’s presidential election—expropriated Repsol’s stake in YPF, the national oil company. It was only partially compensated for the almost $16bn it had paid for the holding in 1999. More recently it has had such trouble sourcing heavy crude from Venezuela and Mexico, it is reportedly considering carrying it from western Canada to its European refineries. 
Yet even without crisis, day-to-day business has been a struggle. BBVA and Santander have used their big Latin America subsidiaries to help offset zero interest rates closer to home, and have no plans to pull out. Now Mexico, where BBVA is the biggest bank, is flirting with recession. Santander has done well recently in Brazil, where it is the largest foreign bank. But it suffers from currency weakness in many parts of Latin America. Telefónica’s revenues, returns and cash flows in Peru, Chile and Colombia have flagged owing to competition from scrappy new entrants putting market share ahead of profitability. 
Spain is not yet in full retreat. Telefónica’s moves could be a combination of selling assets, as it is doing in Central America, and forming alliances, as it has recently done in Mexico by agreeing to use part of AT&T’s network as a way to reduce losses. But it may sell up altogether to reduce debt quickly. Firms such as Liberty Latin America and Millicom are expanding fast around the region, largely through acquisitions. China Mobile is showing interest in Latin America as well. Telefónica’s decision to stay put in Brazil, by far its biggest market, suggests that its new mantra is focus. 
Other Spanish firms have made similar calculations: BBVA by concentrating mainly on Mexico, and Santander on Brazil. As pressure increases on banks to adapt to the fintech era, and on energy firms like Repsol and Iberdrola to reduce carbon emissions, focus makes more sense than empire-building. Even Cortés was forced to make a tactical retreat in 1520 in what is called “La Noche Triste”. For Telefónica, this is undoubtedly a “sad night”. But if its retreat is more than tactical, other firms may sound one, too. ■
