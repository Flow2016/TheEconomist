You misrepresented the position of the Brazilian government on the protection of the Amazon rainforest (“Deathwatch”, August 3rd). In fact, combating deforestation is an unwavering commitment of the government. The single largest operation ever conducted to combat illegal deforestation in the Amazon took place recently, on June 5th. It brought together 165 federal environmental agents, who dismantled a criminal organisation specialising in illegal logging and timber trafficking. 
Brazil has reduced deforestation in the Amazon by 72% over the past 15 years. We have regenerated 9.4m hectares of vegetation (more than the total area of Scotland) and replanted forests in another 2m hectares. As the report rightly indicates, Brazilian agriculture is a clear example of how environmental protection and economic development can go hand in hand. Only 30% of Brazilian territory is dedicated to agriculture and ranching, while in European countries these figures usually range between 45% and 65%. 
The deforestation data published in June come from a satellite system, DETER, the main purpose of which is not to generate compiled deforestation rates, but to release deforestation warnings to guide the work of forces on the ground. It is a crucial instrument, which will be preserved, but one that is not suitable for this kind of analysis. Deforestation rates are published once a year through a different satellite system, PRODES. Finally, as an additional layer of oversight, the Brazilian government is buying a new system of high-resolution satellite images to be collected on a daily basis. This will be another tool in the fight against deforestation.

I read your report while bouncing down logging roads in the Madre de Dios region of the Peruvian Amazon. During my visit I personally took a chainsaw to an 80-year-old cumaru tree. But for our harvesting that tree eventually would have stopped growing, stopped metabolising carbon dioxide into oxygen and decomposed, releasing its carbon and methane. Instead, the tree’s lumber will be turned into useful products and its carbon sequestered. More importantly, these concessions will protect the forest for up to 80 years. Leaving this managed paradise, I saw first-hand what happens to forests that aren’t sustainably harvested. They are burned to the ground to make way for farms and mines. 
Sustainable forestry is our best opportunity to preserve the lungs of our planet, by ensuring that the Amazon is sustainably commercial. We should be consuming more wood products, as I’m sure my fellow subscribers to the print edition would agree.

Can we all stop pretending that humanity cares about the environment? The reality is that the organising principle of civilisation is maximising consumption. When consumerism runs up against the environment, consumerism will, in the end, win. The sooner public policy faces up to this fact the better. Sadly, the only Amazon most people care about is the one that offers same-day delivery.

Just because a good idea becomes well-known, or widely accepted, doesn’t make it any less effective. Buttonwood (July 20th) raised the question of whether investment factors such as value, momentum, size, quality and minimum volatility may lose their long-term effectiveness because of overcrowding. Yet a large body of academic work, including from six Nobel-prize winners, has substantiated the broad and persistent returns generated by these investment strategies over time. 
In published research papers, we have estimated factor capacity by examining assets managed in those strategies* and weighing transaction costs**. Our findings suggest there is ample capacity to make factor investing effective for some time to come. Based on our research, the amount of money allocated to factor strategies is a fraction of the $26trn in total market capitalisation of the broader S&P 500 Index (as of July 31st). Factor- investing strategies have the capacity to absorb more than 100 times the amount that is invested today. We believe factor strategies globally may reach at least hundreds of billions and, in many cases, trillions of dollars of assets before we concern ourselves with capacity.

Speech is not violenceToni Morrison was a great writer, but her statement, “Oppressive language does more than represent violence; it is violence” is off the mark (“On malign words”, August 10th). In fact, it contradicts the First Amendment of the constitution, which relies on the distinction between oppressive speech and violence, protecting the former but not the latter. Morrison was right that oppressive language should “be rejected, altered and exposed”, but the government may not punish it.

Charlemagne mused about how the electric scooter is making European cities car-free (August 3rd). But a study of e-scooters in Barcelona by the automobile club found that 38% of the people that took to them used to walk, 10% used to cycle and 33% used to travel by public transport. Only 10% replaced their car or motorbike with an e-scooter. The overall effect of e-scooters might be negative, as people stand on them instead of walking or cycling and they take custom away from public transport.

Bartleby has an unerring ability to detect the nonsense emanating from HR (July 13th). At my job operating a drawbridge I am expected to set performance goals relating to “core competencies.” These include building relationships, oriented outcomes, creativity and innovation. Curiously, they do not include safely operating the 900-tonne piece of mechanical infrastructure entrusted to my care. At my annual review, learning agility is defined in terms of “an awareness of changing workplace trends”. That such skills are valued more highly than not crushing pedestrians says something.

“Weak foundations” (July 20th) reported that declining sales of decorative paints foretold the downturn in 2008. In the early days of the consultancy I work for we used to ask one of the partners how his family’s dry-cleaning business was doing. When people tighten their belts, we noticed that the first thing they do is to postpone the dry-cleaning of their smart suits and dresses.
