The Economist is concerned about Elizabeth Warren’s “dubious…vilification of business” (“A plan for American capitalism”, October 26th). Yet the principles that lie behind the Democratic presidential candidate’s proposals are similar to those found in parts of Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations”. He too argued that wide gaps between the classes are dangerous and thought that the most scrupulous and suspicious attention should be paid to any policy plans coming from businessmen. 
In recent decades gains from productivity increases have been monopolised by the wealthy, a contrast to Smith’s belief that productivity gains from the division of labour lift the lowest ranks of people. Ms Warren advocates a return to the Glass-Steagall Act; Smith also called for the careful regulation of banking. 
It is right to be concerned about excessive government, but Smith himself said there is a role for government when businesspeople neglect ethics. Today’s market system needs a significant course correction towards the direction of equal justice. Such a correction would be entirely consistent with Smith’s simple secret for prosperity: justice, liberty and equality.

You concluded that Ms Warren underestimates “the dynamic power of markets to help middle-class Americans”. But for years now the American middle classes have witnessed their own destruction by unleashed market forces. 
The “power of markets” allowed my family’s health-insurance company to deny payments for crucial tests and hospital care during the treatment of a life-threatening disease (the doctors who helped us through endless appeals often do this for long lists of very sick patients). The university where I teach has opened food banks in recent years. And during the wave of foreclosures it was not the invisible hand of the market but our local congresswoman who reached out to help families keep their homes.

As a Republican who lived in California for 40 years, and who was a close neighbour of Ronald Reagan, my politics have changed since living in Norway. Capitalism is based on selfishness. The welfare states are based on unselfish love. If equality of opportunity is an essential element of an efficient, happy and healthy society, Elizabeth and Bernie are on the right track.

Ms Warren has properly diagnosed America’s problems, but she is offering the wrong prescriptions. Not only do they have no chance of passing legislative muster, they won’t even gain the support of many Democrats. Her plans are heavy-handed and expensive, and do not recognise what many studies of human behaviour have verified over the years: incentives work better than regulation.

Helmut Kohl’s decision to swap East German Ostmarks at the same exchange rate as Deutschmarks was one cause of the discontentment surrounding German unification (“Thirty years after the Wall fell”, November 2nd). More important was the West German unions imposing their own collective wage bargaining on less productive East German workers, thus preventing their western production line moving east. This resulted in the deindustrialisation of the former East Germany. Compounding this was the transfer of the generous West German welfare system to the lower cost-of-living East, making unemployment a long- term occupation for many. My own analysis of Germany’s Mezzogiorno (fiscal transfers from west-to-east and labour migration from east-to-west) showed how ten years after the collapse of communism the German state often paid more in welfare than the average salary in the East German labour market. Now, 30 years on, many of those who were unemployed will be claiming state pensions.

“Democrats in Dixie” (November 2nd) suggested that John Bel Edwards, the Democratic governor of Louisiana, is the only person from his party to hold that office “in the South”. No doubt you meant the Deep South. North Carolina and Virginia also have Democratic governors. To your point about pragmatic local politics, in the election of 2016 voters in North Carolina replaced the incumbent Republican governor (who supported the divisive bathroom bill) with a Democrat, and at the same time voted for Donald Trump.

I am not surprised that the food is so unpopular at Larkhill Garrison (“Marching on its stomach”, October 26th). I was the last director of defence catering before the position vanished. British soldiers used to have a small amount of money, known as the daily messing rate, deducted from their pay each month. This covered as much food and beverages as they wanted, and really needed—infantrymen burn calories at a terrific rate and eat a huge amount of food. The meals were nutritionally balanced. But this old system was decreed unfair by a bunch of MPs and civil servants because some troops ate less than others, and some may have even missed meals. 
So the Ministry of Defence brought in a system called Pay as You Dine, or pay as you die as some soldiers call it. They now pay cash at each meal for what they actually consume. Big eaters, like the infantry, clearly pay more. It is a bad deal; many soldiers run out of money halfway through the month. I objected to the new system, but the civil servants won the day. Far too much military logistics is now contracted out. One day lives will be lost on operations as a result. Remember the Crimea?

In 2018 I had the misfortune to stay overnight at an army base. The catering in the officers’ mess was so bad that I wrote to the chief of the general staff, to say that if this was the standard for officers, what was it like for soldiers? He replied that he was extremely satisfied with present standards and that the managing-director of a London hotel was available for advice when required.

“I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,” William Rehnquist said about his oversight of Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial (“Trying times”, October 26th). The then chief justice of the Supreme Court quoted those lines from “Iolanthe”, his favourite opera by Gilbert and Sullivan. In fact, the costume worn by the lord-chancellor character in one particular production of “Iolanthe” inspired Rehnquist to add gold stripes to the sleeves of his justice’s robe, so that he would stand out.
