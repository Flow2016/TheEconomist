Unrest flared again in Hong Kong after a protester died. Another was shot at close range by a police officer, allegedly while trying to grab his gun. A man was set on fire by demonstrators after remonstrating with them. One senior officer said society was on the “brink of a total breakdown”. The Chinese government said Hong Kong was “sliding into the abyss of terrorism”. See article. 
China’s president, Xi Jinping, paid a visit to Greece, an important partner in the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to improve global infrastructure. The two countries said they would work to “overcome any obstacles” facing a Chinese state-owned company’s plan to upgrade the port of Piraeus. Mr Xi promised support for Greece’s campaign to secure the return of the Elgin marbles from Britain. 
India’s Supreme Court awarded the site of a mosque in the city of Ayodhya that was demolished by Hindu zealots in 1992 to Hindus planning to build a temple to the god Rama. It also criticised the destruction. The government was ordered to provide land nearby for the construction of a new mosque. The decision prompted grumbles from disappointed Muslims, but not the violence many had feared. See article. 
Gambia lodged a complaint against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice on behalf of the OIC, a group of predominantly Muslim countries. They accuse Myanmar of violating the UN convention on genocide in its treatment of Rohingya Muslims. 
Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen, said he would release 70 opposition activists arrested in recent weeks. Under pressure from international donors the government had earlier released Kem Sokha, a prominent opposition leader, from house arrest. See article. 
Evo Morales quit as Bolivia’s president after nearly 14 years in office. The chief of the armed forces had suggested he leave following widespread protests, which broke out after Mr Morales’s victory in a dubious election on October 20th. Mr Morales accepted Mexico’s offer of political asylum. Jeanine Áñez, a political foe of Mr Morales, took office as Bolivia’s interim president. She has said she will hold fresh elections. See article. 
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president from 2003 to 2010, was freed from prison, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, after the country’s highest court decided that people convicted of crimes could not be jailed until they had used up all their appeals. Upon his release Lula attacked the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro. 
Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to begin the process of writing a new constitution. But protesters who are demanding reforms rejected his offer. They want an assembly of citizens, rather than congress, to draft the new document. 
Israel killed a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, setting off a wave of violence. Palestinian militants fired more than 150 rockets into Israel, which responded with air strikes. The fighting may increase the likelihood that the two main political parties in Israel will form a unity government, breaking two months of political deadlock. See article. 
Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, claimed that a new oilfield containing 53bn barrels of crude had been discovered. If true, this would increase Iran’s proven reserves, already one of the world’s largest, by about a third. Iran has struggled to export oil since sanctions were reimposed by America last year. 
The central bank of Zimbabwe began reissuing Zimbabwean dollars after a decade-long hiatus. The new notes are in effect the country’s third currency in the past three years. The government has tried to stay a step ahead of a shortage of cash caused by high inflation and economic mismanagement. 
Spain’s general election, the fourth in four years, gave no party a majority. The Socialists, who had been hoping to move closer to one, actually lost three seats. They swiftly struck a deal with the far-left Podemos party to attempt to form a coalition. Even together, the two parties will need to find support among several regional parties to get over the line. See article. 
Venice was hit by its worst floods for half a century. Water entered St Mark’s Basilica, causing “grave damage”, according to the city’s mayor. 
The Dutch government backtracked on previous pledges and reduced road speed limits to 100kph (62mph) during the day to help meet a court-ordered reduction in emissions. Farmers have also been asked to cut back on livestock in order to reduce nitrogen. 
In the British election campaign, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party got a boost when Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, said he would not field candidates in the 317 seats the Tories won in 2017. The pressure was on Mr Farage to go further and withdraw from all constituencies where his party threatens to split the Leave vote. See article. 
The first public hearings were held in the inquiry that will determine whether Donald Trump should be impeached for asking the Ukrainian government to dig up political dirt on Joe Biden. The first witnesses in the Democratic-led process were diplomats with responsibility for Ukraine. See article. 
America’s Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Remington, a gunmaker, to block a lawsuit from relatives of the victims in the Sandy Hook school massacre of 2012, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. The lawsuit accuses Remington of illegally marketing combat weapons. 
An appeal by a murderer against his life sentence on the ground that he had already “died” in hospital was rejected by a court in Iowa. Benjamin Schreiber argued that his heart had stopped during an emergency procedure in 2015. But the judges concluded that the convict “is either still alive…or he is actually dead, in which case this appeal is moot”.
