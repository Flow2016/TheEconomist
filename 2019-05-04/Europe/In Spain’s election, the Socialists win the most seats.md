###### Sánchez’s new day
# In Spain’s election, the Socialists win the most seats 
##### But forming a viable government will take time and allies

CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT on April 28th, with the vote-count in the general election all but over, the scenes outside the headquarters of Spain’s two main political parties said it all. “We’ve sent a message to Europe and the world…that you can defeat reaction [and] authoritarianism,” Pedro Sánchez told a cheering crowd of several hundred activists from his Socialist party. A couple of kilometres away, barely a dozen people stood outside the offices of the conservative People’s Party (PP) until workers dismantled, unused, an elaborate stage. Speaking inside to journalists, a dejected Pablo Casado, the PP’s leader, admitted: “It’s been a very bad result.” Mr Sánchez led the Socialists to their first win (in the sense of taking the most seats, though still well short of a majority) since 2008, while the PP’s very future, and certainly that of its leader, looks uncertain. 
Back last May when he filed a censure motion that brought him to office and ended more than six years of PP rule under Mariano Rajoy, Mr Sánchez brushed off demands for an immediate election. With less than a quarter of the Congress, he governed for ten months through gestures—a big rise in the minimum wage, which employers say discourages job creation—and symbolic acts, such as a yet-to-be-fulfilled commitment to move the remains of General Franco, Spain’s former dictator, from his grandiose memorial. But although he opted to call fresh elections after failing to pass a budget, the Socialists gained 2m more votes and 38 more seats compared with the previous ballot in 2016. 
The election increased the fragmentation of what was once a two-party system. The right splintered into three, and paid a price for that in lost seats. The PP lost more than half its seats and 3.5m votes, its worst result since its foundation in 1989. Ciudadanos, a formerly liberal party that has moved to the right, came within 220,000 votes of it. The hard right, in the shape of Vox, a newish nationalist party, will be represented in Congress for the first time since 1982. But with only 24 seats and 10.3% of the vote, it fell short of forecasts. 
What Mr Sánchez mocked as “the primary of the right” stamped an ill-tempered character on the campaign. Mr Casado, Ciudadanos and Vox all tried to make the election about national unity. That was threatened in 2017 when the separatist administration in Catalonia staged an unconstitutional referendum and a unilateral declaration of independence. The right castigated Mr Sánchez for having held inconclusive talks with Catalan officials. Mr Casado called him a “felon”, and Albert Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, declared that he was “not a constitutionalist” and that Spain faced a “national emergency”. Both wanted to impose direct rule in Catalonia; Vox wants to abolish Spain’s regional governments altogether.

Mr Sánchez insisted he had done no deals with the separatists—their failure to support his budget triggered the election—and will never agree to an independence referendum. He said the issues were “concord” and social justice after the spending cuts following the economic slump of 2009-13. In the event, the spectre of Vox helped Mr Sánchez mobilise his voters. A high turnout of 76% on a spring day also helped the Catalan separatists, who won 22 seats, up from 17, though the big winner among them was Esquerra, the most pragmatic of the pro-independence parties. 
If he wants to be able to tackle deep-seated problems, such as high youth unemployment and unsustainable pensions, Mr Sánchez will need allies to govern in the 350-seat Congress. Securing them will be complicated. “From our position on the left, we will extend our hand to all political forces [who operate] within the constitution,” he said on election night. One option is to join forces with Podemos, a much-further-left outfit with 42 seats (down from 71), and make up the numbers with the moderate Basque nationalists and assorted regional parties. Pablo Iglesias, Podemos’s leader, has been pressing for a formal coalition, which would be a first in Spain’s current democratic period. But this would still be short of a majority. And many Socialist voters recoil at Podemos’s commitment to an independence referendum in Catalonia. Businesses, too, are scared of Podemos entering government, even though Mr Iglesias has moderated his stance and is not quite the firebrand of the left he once was. 
A stronger, but politically harder, option would be a coalition with Ciudadanos. This week Mr Rivera again ruled that out. Socialist activists listening to Mr Sánchez outside party headquarters chanted “Not with Rivera”. But the main business organisations have urged both men to reconsider, or at least that Ciudadanos (and the PP) abstain to allow Mr Sánchez to be invested as prime minister. 
For the moment, Socialist leaders say they will govern alone, seeking support as needed, where they can. Whether that remains the position will become clear only after the new Congress convenes on May 21st and after yet another election, this one on May 26th for mayors, 12 regional governments and the European Parliament. 
The Spanish right faces a hard task of rebuilding. Unless the PP does much better on May 26th, Mr Casado may be forced out. He chose to turn the PP’s broad church into an ideological sect, purging moderates and bringing in an inexperienced team. His attempt to echo rather than challenge Vox, whose origins lie in a breakaway from the PP, failed. The PP lost 1.6m of its voters to Vox, as well as 1.4m to Ciudadanos, according to an analysis for El Mundo, a newspaper. One of them was Alfonso Pérez, a bank worker. “The union of Spain is fundamental,” he said as he listened to Vox’s final campaign rally in Madrid. 
For Mr Sánchez, who was briefly ejected as party leader in 2016-17 and was widely written off by Socialist grandees, the election was a personal triumph. The days of absolute majorities in Spain are over for the time being. But the country’s prime minister has delivered rare good news for social democracy ahead of the election for the European Parliament.
