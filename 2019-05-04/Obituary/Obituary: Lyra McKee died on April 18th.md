LIKE MANY a small child, Lyra McKee at four years old was all questions. Why should her mother, who was poor and had six children and was bringing them up single-handed on the Cliftonville Road in north Belfast, have to pay her bills? Why would she go to jail if she didn’t? No answer ever satisfied her, and she would leave her mother with “Why?” ringing in her ears. 
It didn’t stop when she got older, though. Her hero was Walt Disney’s Robin Hood, a talking fox who righted wrongs and, obviously, unearthed them first. So she was almost bound to become, as she did, the most dogged investigative journalist. She got especially persistent if she felt there were secrets involved, things people didn’t want anyone to know. These she had to find out. Not all at once, A-Z, which quickly bored her, but little clues, a breadcrumb trail, which she could follow to see where it led. 
She was lucky, or perhaps unlucky, that she lived in Northern Ireland, where secrets were everywhere. In her Catholic section of Belfast part of this was cultural, so that having children out of wedlock was shameful and suicide in the family was a disgrace, both to be buried deep. And then there was her own huge, aching secret that she had kept close since the age of 11, that she was gay and damned to hell for it, much as she spent long nights in bed bargaining with God to let her off. As a teenager she knew only one boy who was openly gay, Big Gay Mick with his thin body and baseball cap and camp too-high voice. No one else was that brave, and until he spoke you might have taken him too for one of the hard men who still loitered along Murder Mile, as people called it. 
There lay the biggest nest of secrets. The 30-year Troubles between unionists and republicans, Catholics and Protestants, had officially ended when she was eight with the Good Friday Agreement, and after that the long civil war was swept under the carpet or was wrapped like a wound under bandages, whatever metaphor you liked; but hidden, although it still permeated everything. In one article in 2016 she looked into the fact, barely spoken of, that in the ten years after the end of the Troubles the suicide rate had almost doubled in the province, with a fifth of the victims younger than 25. She raised the idea, again hardly mentioned, that trauma might be passed down from parents to “Ceasefire Babies”, like herself, who had never known fighting directly but lived in its shadow and, sometimes, died from it. 
Certain stories turned her into a workaholic monster, working all night and never switching off. A man called Thomas was murdered, and a source told her this was “something related to children”; in 1978 he had passed information about child pornography to the police, but there the trail ended. What then? In 2012 she took up the case of Robert Bradford, a prominent politician shot dead in 1981, who was rumoured to have been “asking questions”. About what, no one would say. But she had to know. In 2017, in Harlem Café just by Ulster Hall, a veteran journalist (often the best sources for young cubs like her) casually mentioned that “a lot of kids” had disappeared during the Troubles. Immediately she had to find out: who? why? where from? And where were the bodies now? 
People often asked her who she was working for. The truth was, mostly not for anyone, or only for the public, who had a right to know. Her route through journalism had been really haphazard. At Queen’s University, where she went for a spell before she dropped out, finding it too like school, she asked a newspaper editor at a careers fair whether he hired investigative reporters, and he laughed at her. No, they didn’t hire those people any more. She trundled between online media sites and online news, publishing here and there, but it was a struggle. One article that took six months’ research earned her £50. A lot of the time she was broke. Still, she got her MA in investigative journalism from Birmingham and ended up doing what she loved most in the world, so she was rich for that. 
Rich from muckraking, such a good word: “to search for and expose misconduct in public life”. It was very hard in Northern Ireland, as her Muckraker blog laid bare every week. A Freedom of Information request to the police brought the preposterous answer that it would take them 10,692 hours to look through six months of files for the missing children. Her prime source for “Thomas’s Story” gave her information that was 80% verifiable, but then had that gap in it. Documents were embargoed. She would spend hours upon hours digging, only to find nothing and feel useless. 
Her readers helped, though. She saw them as her collaborators. Her social network was so wide—all genders, ages, faiths, persuasions—that if one potential source jibbed at talking to a gay Catholic with an unkempt geeky look and a Harry Potter T-shirt, another would say, “She’s all right.” Then the site she mostly worked for, Beacon Reader, allowed readers to fund their favourite reporters, and she ran with that. She eventually thrived as a freelance because she crowdfunded her research into Bradford and the lost children, giving subscribers exclusive online chunks of her findings and her writings. This brought in $6,000, led to articles in places like Private Eye, the Atlantic and BuzzFeed, and won her time to turn her research into a two-book deal with Faber. With the news industry as it was, she would tell younger journalists (for she was giving lots of talks now), muckrakers had to be entrepreneurs. 
It seemed a long time since all that crazy bargaining with God and her misery about her own secret. She had told her family when she was 20 and they had been fine with it, and some years later she told her parish priest, Martin Magill, and that was fine, too. Far from being damned, her career was booming, she had found the love of her life in Sara Canning and had moved to Derry-Londonderry—hateful name, great city!—to be with her. All people had to do was talk to each other, and walls would tumble down. 
But of course some still wouldn’t talk. They’d fob that pesky journalist off. Paper trails ran out, or had never existed in the first place. And then what? It seemed the best course might be to sniff when trouble might happen and get up close to it, witness it with her own two eyes, right beside the gunmen and the police.
