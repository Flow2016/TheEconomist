Your leader about Notre Dame cathedral attributed the enormous emotional response to the fire to such factors as global tourism and a uniting love of culture (“The human spark”, April 20th). All true. Yet for the French, Notre Dame is the closest physical embodiment of their deep sense of nationhood. Their concern arises directly from the sudden physical threat to this unparalleled national symbol. The response is above all a powerful and positive expression of national identity, culture and history; a contrast to the destructive “rising threat” of nationalism that you mentioned. 
DAVID GRIFFITHSChiddingfold, Surrey 
You pondered the human instinct “to care more about a building than about people”. Let’s do a thought experiment. Donald Trump tweets, “I am more concerned about the fire at Notre Dame than I am about 1,000 black Africans.” It is easy to imagine the reaction. I’m sure The Economist would be first in line to condemn him with no small hint of superciliousness.

I hope that, like Quasimodo, you ultimately realise that gargoyles and statues are an inadequate substitute for true human connection. A single life is more valuable than any building.

Your endorsement of the ruling African National Congress ahead of South Africa’s general election was unconscionable (“South Africa’s best bet”, April 27th). The ANC is a criminal syndicate that will destroy South Africa if it remains in power for another decade. Your argument that a stronger mandate will help President Cyril Ramaphosa push through a reform agenda by somehow strengthening him against the crooks in his party is deeply flawed, as no mechanism exists for this. 
The ANC’s candidate lists prove he has already lost that battle. They are jam-packed with crooks. This is the same crowd that supported Jacob Zuma through eight motions of no confidence as he destroyed the country’s institutions. South Africa is on its knees after 25 years of one-party dominance by a patronage-driven party that works only to enrich a connected elite. Our democracy urgently needs a strong alternative.  
A strong showing for the liberal Democratic Alliance will make the ANC more responsive to the country’s interests and prevent it, together with the socialist Economic Freedom Fighters, from achieving the majority required to change the constitution to enable expropriation without compensation. As for Mr Ramaphosa’s supposed “reform agenda”, there is little evidence of this other than his tepid fight against corruption. He has supported the attack on property rights and the forced investment of pension funds into chronically corrupt, bankrupt state-owned enterprises as well as the nationalisation of the central bank and of the health system. Mr Ramaphosa was tasked with fixing Eskom in 2015; today the power utility is in a death spiral and looks set to take our economy down with it. 
The Economist’s endorsement places it on the wrong side of history.  
JOHN STEENHUISENChief whip of the Democratic Alliance in the National AssemblyCape Town* There will be many liberal democrats in South Africa who will agree with your support for Cyril Ramaphosa. In fact that makes sense to a lot of Democrats. But voting for the ANC is a very different matter. Democratic Alliance members who are persuaded by your excellent analysis to vote ANC will simply be swallowed up in the ANC numbers to the loss of the one party in South Africa with a genuine and proven commitment to liberal values and constitutional democracy. This is because there is no way of validating their votes, as general elections in South Africa, as in Britain, are about support for parties and not individuals. Also, the fact is that the stronger the DA emerges from this election the better for the country as a whole and Cyril Ramaphosa. 
This election, or more specifically its outcome, is almost completely irrelevant to the state the country is in. The election will happen on May 8th, but the next day many South Africans will still wake up to being hungry and not having a job or access to the most elementary domestic services; to an unreliable Eskom, to a bankrupt SAA, a debt-burdened SABC and numerous other similarly crippled state entities, so adding to a shocking government debt of 55% of GDP and increasing by the day; low and declining economic growth and the lack of domestic and international investor confidence; one of the worlds’s top mining industries and a source of enormous employment broken as a consequence of government policy and interference; high levels of unemployment, particularly in respect to youth; delivery service failures mainly affecting the poorer classes; deteriorating credit-worthiness and declining productivity and a grossly incompetent and bloated public service. Yet one of the most costly governments around.So South Africans will wake up after the excitement and buzz of the election to a country which has been mismanaged for 25 years. And if our political system as presently operated, and our politicians can’t turn things around, what should be done?R.W. Johnson has mentioned the possibility of South Africa needing an IMF bail-out. This is the best course if South Africa is to avoid a serious calamity as a country and a people. Given that the election is unlikely even marginally to change the South African social and economic reality for the better or improve the lives of citizens or seriously contribute to solving the challenges we face, spelling out and promoting IMF involvement becomes a post-election imperative. That’s when Mr Ramaphosa and the people closest to him, either as president or leader of the Ramaphosa faction of a divided ANC, is going to need support. And that is why the stronger the Democratic Alliance is, the better.DENIS WORRALLFormer South African ambassador to London 
Charlemagne justifiably argues that a common European foreign policy is hard to achieve given historic differences among member states (April 20th). But don’t underestimate the value of trying. Without the effort to achieve a common view, divergences would be all the greater. Failures in Libya or the Middle East should not overshadow the relative successes on China, Russia, Iran, the Sahel and Somalia. Other powers will always seek to divide EU member states in order to weaken them. So an effective voice in the world requires hanging together rather than hanging apart. It requires infinite patience and endless ingenuity with no guarantee of success; but that’s diplomacy.

A cartographic clash* The possible change of the colour depicting Taiwan on “The World Turned Upside Down” sculpture at London School of Economics is of grave concern (“Art attack”, April 13th). Since Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China, changing the colour of Taiwan on the sculpture is erroneous as it simply does not reflect the fact. Moreover, it is Britain’s longstanding government policy and position to refer to Taiwan simply as “Taiwan”.The LSE’s citing United Nations delineations, rather than its own government’s policy, as the authority to decide the content of public artwork, and more importantly, to represent its own perspective and position, will seriously damage its own reputation as one of the freest and most respected academic institutions in the world.In this respect, it is important that the LSE will acknowledge the reality of the existence of democratic Taiwan and the democratically-elected president, Dr. Tsai Ing-wen, who, insidentally, is also a proud alumna of the LSE.Following the announcement of the LSE’s decision on the sculpture, we have received many messages of support both from politicians and members of the public regarding keeping the sculpture in its originally intended state, including an online petition that has garnered over 10,000 signatures, evidencing support against the aggressive moves of Chinese students to alter the status quo.I therefore strongly urge the LSE not to bow to Chinese students’ pressure and maintain the sculpture’s original depiction of Taiwan.DAVID LIN Representative Taipei Representative Office in the United KingdomLondon 
The arguments you presented in favour of private education don’t stack up against the evidence (“A class apart”, April 13th). Studies from the OECD, UNESCO and the World Bank, among others, clearly find that private schools do not perform better than public schools. Private education also perpetuates disadvantage and exclusion. The EU has adopted a resolution stipulating that member states must not use development aid to support commercial educational establishments, because they go against the grain of the EU’s principles, aligned to the UN’s goal of inclusive education. 
Empowered educators and robust teachers’ unions make for strong education systems, according to the OECD. Teachers and their unions are part of the solution. Instead of urging governments to weaken unions, you should persuade them to work with unions to strengthen public education. 
DAVID EDWARDSEducation InternationalBrussels 
I wish you had devoted more analysis to the American system. During the gradual move towards more “choice” in education, such as charter schools and the use of vouchers, mathematics results have declined in America when ranked with other countries or in time-series tests. The performance of high-school sophomores in the OECD’s PISA studies have placed America below the mean of all countries. A measure to test college readiness for maths in 2018 revealed that 60% had failed. That is after a decade of more school choice. More research to explain this decline is needed. 
BERTRAND HORWITZAsheville, North Carolina 
You cited data showing the greater efficiency (outcome per dollar) of private education in India. Yet the reverse is the case in developed countries. As you noted, educational outcomes are about equal in private and public systems in OECD countries, even though spending per student is substantially higher in the private sector. Efficiency and equity therefore imply using the tax system to increase spending in public education, rather than encouraging private expenditure. 
Moreover, public education is a means of achieving integration in societies with lots of migrants. Yet, in Australia at least, subsidies to private education have enabled recent migrant groups to segregate their children into low-fee private schools. 
In a free society, parents must be able to choose private education. This does not imply the right to public subsidies. 
REX DEIGHTON-SMITHParis 
The acronym YIMBY, “yes in my backyard”, is not quite right (“Sorry, we’re full”, April 20th). When you look closely at the backers of this movement for new development and housing in the crowded Bay Area, you find that the acronym is more accurately YIYBY, “yes in your backyard”.
