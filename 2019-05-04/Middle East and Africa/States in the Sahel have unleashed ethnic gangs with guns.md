THE FIRST sound of danger was the roar of motorbikes. Then came the gunfire as about 20 men attacked Samani, a village in central Mali, killing three people and cutting off body parts as trophies. They took the chief’s 30-year-old son, “cut him in half, and took his heart out”, says Amadou Barry, an elder who managed to escape to Bamako, Mali’s capital. 
The gunmen were from an ethnic militia, one of hundreds that have sprouted in Mali and Burkina Faso, and that have killed at least 800 people since the beginning of 2018. The militias are most active in Mali, which has battled a jihadist insurgency since 2012. Many emerged from groups of hunters, who used to stalk game with flintlock guns. Now they are armed with assault rifles and speed about on motorbikes. They say they hunt jihadists. In reality they are targeting Fulanis, a mainly Muslim minority group. Photos on social media show Fulani villages in which families have been shot, their bodies thrown down wells or cut to pieces. “We should call it what it is: ethnic cleansing,” says Héni Nsaibia, from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, an NGO. 
The army has made no serious attempt to disarm these militias, said Human Rights Watch, a watchdog, in December. Instead, the government has helped them. Some army units patrol with them. They have been exempted from a ban on motorbikes (supposedly the jihadists’ favourite ride) in central Mali. This allows the militias to attack with ease. Emboldened by the government’s inaction, militiamen hacked and burned to death more than 170 people in Ogossagou, central Mali, in March. This favouritism plays into the hands of the jihadists, who find it easiest to recruit among oppressed minorities such as the Fulani, which are also forming their own militias. Some jihadists have urged all Fulanis to join their fight. 
The situation is hardly better in Burkina Faso, where thousands of men have joined groups called Koglweogo (guardians of the bush). They started out as vigilante groups that beat or killed alleged criminals. But many now demand money from villagers and torture those who do not pay. 
Some estimate there are about 4,500 Koglweogo groups, most with at least 20 men, mainly from the majority Mossi ethnic group. They are being sucked into conflict with the Fulani. In January Koglweogo fighters massacred some 210 mostly Fulani people in Yirgou in northern Burkina Faso. Instead of arresting the attackers, the government told the victims to forgive them. 
The government’s shameful reaction partly reflects its weakness. But there may be a darker motive. Many members of the government are Mossi, and may think it useful to have an ethnic militia on hand before elections next year. 
Yet by allowing militias to arm and multiply, governments “have created a monster”, says a UN official in the Sahel. Having let this demon out of the box, they will struggle to put it back.
