# A failed uprising against Nicolás Maduro 
##### It leaves many unanswered questions about the Trump administration’s plan for regime change

> May 2nd 2019 
ON MAY 1st, the day after the opposition announced a final push to oust Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s strongman was determined to show he was back in control. He used the method his regime knows best: swift, forceful repression of protests. Juan Guaidó, recognised by most Western and Latin American democracies as the country’s interim president, had promised the “biggest march in Venezuelan history” to prise open the cracks in the regime. It didn’t happen. When protesters approached La Carlota, an air base in eastern Caracas, they were dispersed by a rain of tear-gas canisters the moment they began aiming stones at the conscripts inside. Two people died in demonstrations and dozens were injured. 
Just a day earlier the opposition had hoped that its long struggle against Mr Maduro’s dictatorship was on the brink of success. But the collapse of what briefly looked like a co-ordinated uprising with military backing represents a big setback for the opposition and its backers in the Trump administration. At the same time, these events displayed Mr Maduro’s weakness as well as his strength. 
At dawn on April 30th Mr Guaidó had appeared outside La Carlota with a small group of national guardsmen to announce “Operation Liberty”. By his side stood Leopoldo López, the country’s most famous political prisoner, who had been freed from house arrest by his guards from SEBIN, the feared intelligence service. For several hours, rumours flew that the army had at last abandoned a hated regime and backed a transition to democracy. Then, one by one, General Vladimir Padrino, the defence minister, and other senior military figures posted on social media statements of loyalty to Mr Maduro and denunciations of what one called “a small coup”. 
In the evening of April 30th Mr Maduro at last appeared on television, flanked by the high command. He vowed to pursue all of those behind the uprising. “Sooner, rather than later, they will go to prison to pay for their treason and crimes,” he said later. The general in charge of SEBIN, Christopher Figuera, was apparently sacked. Mr López and his family took refuge in the Spanish ambassador’s residence, while two dozen rebel national guardsmen were reported to be in the Brazilian embassy. 
Mr Maduro, who started a second term in January after winning a sham election, has plunged the country into economic misery. But despite discontent, and occasional defections of small groups of soldiers, the regime has managed to keep the loyalty of the armed forces. American officials stress the role of Cuban intelligence surveillance in quashing military dissent. That is certainly important in preventing moves by individual commanders. 
But there is little doubt that the army could act as a body to dump Mr Maduro if the high command wanted. That was the supposition on which the opposition plan was based. Whether the commanders have sufficient incentives to do so is another matter. Mr Guaidó has offered them an amnesty. But some are too deeply implicated in criminal activities to qualify. To act, the armed forces need to be sure that their corporate interests will be protected. That probably means giving them a role in a transitional government of national unity, which is anathema to many hardliners in the opposition whose voices are heard in the White House. 
American officials claimed that the attempted uprising followed two months of conversations between Mr Guaidó’s people and senior figures in the regime. John Bolton, the national security adviser, said that the plan was that Maikel Moreno, the head of Venezuela’s supreme court, which has up till now acted as a regime puppet, was to declare Mr Maduro’s national constituent assembly illegitimate. This would have given legal cover to General Padrino and the high command to declare their obedience to the opposition-controlled national assembly, of which Mr Guaidó is the speaker. “For reasons that are still not clear, that didn’t go forward,” Mr Bolton said. He blamed Russian interference for dissuading Mr Maduro from fleeing to Cuba. 
Another explanation comes from Venezuelan military sources cited in El Confidencial, a Spanish digital newspaper. It holds that this plan was due to be put into effect on May 2nd. Perhaps because they thought Mr Maduro and his Cuban spies had discovered the plot, Mr Guaidó and Mr López jumped the gun. That prompted the high command to back off. According to a former American official, that may have been in part because of the presence of Mr López, whom they especially mistrust. 
It is not the first time that the opposition has seemingly overplayed its hand. Some sections of it have long believed that pressure from the streets is sufficient to overthrow Mr Maduro. It has not been. “When the opposition feels it has an advantage it always goes for the kill shot and fails,” says the former American official. 
General Figuera, the former intelligence chief, seemed to confirm Mr Bolton’s accounts of military disloyalty. A letter written to Mr Maduro and attributed to him said: “I discovered that many people you trust are negotiating behind your back.” Whether the dictator can still trust General Padrino, Mr Moreno and the others must now be open to doubt—a doubt the Americans are doing their best to inculcate. Assuming, that is, that the plot itself was not a Cuban-run intelligence operation to force the opposition’s hand, as some speculate. 
For now, the biggest blow is indeed to the momentum of the opposition. More than three months after Mr Guaidó proclaimed himself interim president, with the backing of the United States and over 50 other countries, the regime has not collapsed. In February Mr Guaidó’s attempt to bring in humanitarian aid from Colombia, watched by the world’s media, failed. 
It is widely asserted in Washington that the White House officials who have led the Venezuela effort believed that the army would switch sides in a matter of days. The longer the stand-off continues, the more problematic the strategy of President Donald Trump’s administration becomes. 
Mr Maduro’s government and that of Hugo Chávez before him have brought about Venezuela’s economic collapse. But from now on, American sanctions against Venezuelan oil and finance will play a role in aggravating the country’s humanitarian crisis and the exodus of migrants to neighbouring countries, a point officials in Washington are sensitive about. Unless the stand-off is resolved soon, there is a risk that any transitional government will inherit a country with the living conditions of Haiti. 
What is not in doubt is the determination of the Trump administration to get rid of Mr Maduro’s regime. Having joined this battle, it is one they can ill afford to lose. American diplomacy was initially deft in marshalling a broad coalition behind Mr Guaidó. Optimists think this week showed that it is only a matter of time before the regime fragments. “If Guaidó is not failing, he is winning,” says William Brownfield, a former American ambassador to Venezuela. Mr Guaidó has now called for strikes. But the counter-argument is also strong: Mr Maduro showed his staying power and will now crack down. 
The administration may soon face a choice: make good on Mr Trump’s threats of military action, or hold its nose while Europeans and Latin Americans negotiate with the regime. On May 1st America’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeated that military action is possible. Some White House officials are reported to be impatient for this, though the president himself may not be so enthusiastic. But military action in a large country with many guns in civilian hands would be highly risky. It has no support among the Latin American governments that back Mr Guaidó. 
For the many who want change in Venezuela, this week was intensely frustrating. The strategy of trying to win over the military high command was the correct one. Sadly, its execution was tragicomic.
