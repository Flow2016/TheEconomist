# North Korea’s dictator does not look as clever as he did a year ago 
##### Kim Jong Un has lots of new friends, but no partners

IT IS A year since a nuclear-armed Kim Jong Un set off on a diplomatic dance drawing in the leaders of China, South Korea, the United States and now Russia. The flamboyant approach has turned the family dictatorship’s decades of dour reclusiveness on their head and done much for the North Korean leader’s standing at home and abroad. Korea-watchers say it has increased Mr Kim’s room for manoeuvre and so, by extension, his odds of survival. What a brilliant young despot. Perhaps he really will die peacefully in his bed. 
Last year, on April 27th, Mr Kim met his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, at Panmunjom, the “truce village” where the armistice halting Korea’s civil war had been signed 65 years earlier. Even a hardened press corps gasped at the symbolism. The two held three summits in six months, where predecessors had managed just two in decades. They promised all manner of joint co-operation. Mr Kim has also met four times with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, with whom he even celebrated his birthday. 
As a spectacular, nothing beat Mr Kim’s summit with Donald Trump last June in Singapore. It was followed by a second meeting, in February in Hanoi. Better late to the dance than never, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, rolled out the red carpet for Mr Kim last month. 
But as full as Mr Kim’s dance card has been, the only flirtation that matters is with Mr Trump. Only America presents a serious military threat, and can unlock UN sanctions imposed in response to North Korea’s drive to develop nuclear bombs and long-range missiles. Yet the summit in Hanoi ended in failure. It seems Mr Kim overplayed his hand, expecting Mr Trump to be eager for a deal that would see at least some sanctions eased in exchange for an incomplete dismantling of his nuclear programme. He was taken aback to learn that the Americans knew of a secret nuclear facility that had not been part of discussions. Mr Trump walked away. 
A blow for Mr Kim, and he may not be responding cannily. It is nice to be treated as an equal by Mr Putin, but it gives him little leverage with Mr Trump. Mr Putin loves to needle and upstage America, but he is not about to bail out the failed North Korean state. 
Where Mr Kim has real agency is in his dealings with Mr Moon, whose efforts brought Mr Kim and Mr Trump together. Yet he is blowing it. In South Korea the anniversary of the Panmunjom summit was celebrated with international musicians and a video message from the Pope. Conspicuously absent was any North Korean representation. 
Out of pique at stalled nuclear talks, North Korea is taking things out on the South. All Panmunjom talk of co-operation has gone. In a speech last month Mr Kim attacked Mr Moon, complaining about South Korean authorities “posing as a meddlesome ‘mediator’” just after the South Korean president had visited the White House to urge Mr Trump to keep up the diplomacy. 
It is a return to shrill North Korean form. The South is being blamed for not doing more to keep America dancing. Abusing Mr Moon is surely foolish, says Aidan Foster-Carter, a longtime Korea-watcher. Mr Moon is keen to keep rapprochement going, but is struggling to bring South Koreans along with him. They backed the detente last year. But many have since lost faith in North Korean promises, and interest in reunification. The approval ratings of hawkish conservatives have soared. In power they would make life far harder for Mr Kim. 
Even Mr Kim’s approach towards America is questionable. He still appears to assume that Mr Trump will deal. His leverage is less his nuclear threat than Mr Trump’s claim last year to have done away with it (after Mr Kim suspended his nuclear testing). A test last month of a new short-range guided missile seems calculated to remind the American president that Mr Kim has the power to embarrass him. 
Is that, along with the regime’s attacks on Mike Pompeo, Mr Trump’s chief diplomat, wise? Even Mr Trump would struggle to seal a bad deal in the face of sceptical advisers. Meanwhile, sanctions continue to bite, despite help from Chinese and Russian sanctions-busters. Mr Kim seems minded to respond more by snarling, perhaps with more tests, than by charming. For America and its friends, it hints at a return to a lousy set of options for dealing with North Korea. But it means lousy options for the young despot too. So much for Mr Kim’s supposed brilliance.
