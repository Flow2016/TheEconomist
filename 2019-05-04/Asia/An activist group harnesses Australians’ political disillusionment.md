A GROUP OF protesters gathered outside Tony Abbott’s constituency office on Sydney’s north shore. They wore party hats and cut a cake. It was, the activists explained, an early retirement gathering for Australia’s former prime minister. He is in danger of losing his supposedly safe seat, partly because of the work of their advocacy group, GetUp!, which is campaigning to turf out several of the ruling Liberal Party’s most right-wing members in the general election on May 18th. “Our parties aren’t representing us,” laments one of its volunteers. “They’re representing themselves.” 
Such complaints are common in Australia, but its political system can shroud them. Compulsory voting forces even the disengaged to turn out on election day. Those who might not otherwise vote tend to back one of the two main parties, the Liberals and Labor. The voting system, which requires Australians to rank candidates in order of preference, also ends up funnelling votes to the big two. As a result, the pair continue to dominate politics—they won all but five of the 150 seats in the lower house at the last election, in 2016—even though the share of voters who pick them as their first choice is falling. 
A decade of political instability has left many voters feeling disillusioned. The prime minister has changed five times in that time (but only once because of an election). Policymaking has naturally suffered. “We’re going backwards on too many important issues,” says one of Mr Abbott’s constituents. Some of them lost patience with him in August, when the brigade of staunch conservatives he leads toppled the Liberals’ popular leader, Malcolm Turnbull. The prime minister’s crime had been to attempt to set legally binding targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

Political parties struggle to appeal both to rural constituencies, which clamour for mining jobs, and urban ones, which fret about climate change. Voters also worry about costly housing, insecure jobs and—a relatively new affliction for Australia—stagnant wages. There are fears that big business and foreign governments have undue sway over politicians. According to one poll, faith in democracy has fallen by more than half over the past decade. Only 41% of voters say they are satisfied with the system (see chart). 
Yet many have channelled their disillusionment into activism. More than a million people have joined GetUp!, giving it almost eight times as many members as the two big parties combined. It deploys armies of orange-clad volunteers to man phones and knock on doors. Its donations have soared by more than a quarter over the past year, furnishing it with a war-chest of almost A$13m ($9m). It now has “more capacity than most political parties”, says John Hewson, a former Liberal leader who advised it in its early days. 
Henny Smith, GetUp!’s elections director, says it is “not interested in who gets elected” as long as the result is “sensible climate policy and a conscionable approach to refugees”. But those goals put it at odds with right-wing politicians such as Mr Abbott and Peter Dutton, the pugnacious home-affairs minister who spearheaded the coup against Mr Turnbull. GetUp! is “an extreme left-wing front”, asserts Eric Abetz, a conservative senator. Three investigations by the electoral commission have cleared it of any partisan associations. 
Guessing the extent of GetUp!’s influence is tricky, but Mr Abbott may soon get an inkling. Warringah is doggedly conservative, and he has held the seat for a quarter of a century. But an upset would not be unprecedented: when Mr Turnbull resigned last year, an independent, Kerryn Phelps, deprived the Liberals of his seat for the first time in over a century. The party’s own polling suggests that another independent, Zali Steggall, is on course to beat Mr Abbott with a huge swing of 12%. Mr Dutton holds his suburban seat in Brisbane by a far less comfortable margin, partly thanks to GetUp!’s work at the previous election. The group may need to bake more cakes.
