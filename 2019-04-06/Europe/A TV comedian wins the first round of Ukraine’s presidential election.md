FEW COUNTRIES are as disposed to spectacle and phantasmagoria as Ukraine, the birthplace of Mikhail Bulgakov and Nikolai Gogol. Their shadows, surely, enveloped springtime Kiev on March 31st as a comedian who plays the president in a popular TV show “Servant of the People” emerged as the likely next president of Ukraine. Ukrainian politics have often resembled a reality show. Now a show is turning into reality. 
In the first round of presidential elections Volodymyr Zelensky, an actor who plays a history teacher accidentally propelled into the presidency, won 30% of the votes, as many as the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, and a former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, put together. This was not only a verdict on Mr Poroshenko’s five-year presidency, much of it tainted by persistent corruption scandals, but a resounding slap in the face for the entire Ukrainian class of politicians who have misruled the country for most of its post-Soviet history. 
Mr Zelensky, a man of huge name-recognition and no political experience, took centre-stage to attack the failures of established Ukrainian politicians, who have played different roles in different costumes but have generally acted in their own interests and the interests of the oligarchs who stood behind them. The Maidan revolution of 2013-14 was supposed to mark a break with that system, but instead was hijacked by old-style politicians and oligarchs, including Mr Poroshenko. 
Mr Zelensky’s turn to politics seemed as accidental as that of his character. The idea of stepping from the TV screen into a race emerged two years ago, after Mr Poroshenko’s analysts measured the actor’s ratings only to discover that he was the most popular choice. He was seen, at the time, as a perfect spoiler for Slava Vakarchuk, a well-known rock-singer who tantalised Ukrainians with the idea of a run for the presidency only to back down. He will now face Mr Poroshenko in the second round, scheduled for April 21st. 
Mr Poroshenko, a confectionery magnate, also came to the presidency almost by accident. He was elected to stop the war in the east of the country and improve the country’s dire economic situation, and for this election wrapped himself in the flag and campaigned under the slogan of “Army. Language. Faith”. He chose Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, as his real election opponent and appealed to more nationalist-minded western Ukraine, leaving the Russian-speaking east and south of the country to Yury Boyko, a Kremlin-backed former energy minister. 
Mr Zelensky, not wishing to divide opinions and votes, said almost nothing about his politics. He did not hold political rallies or take part in television debates. Instead he toured the country giving two shows a day—one free, one paid. Unlike his rivals, who had to work hard to get people to come to their to rallies, Mr Zelensky actually made money from ticket sales. But those who voted for him have little idea about the man behind the screen.

He is 41, of a Jewish background, and comes from a rough industrial city, Krivoy Rog. His team consists of cool-headed lawyers, close friends and business partners who run a tight ship. His business dealings with Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial oligarch whose TV channel hosts Mr Zelensky’s show and whose top lawyer is on his campaign team, raised questions that were quickly exploited by Mr Poroshenko. But Mr Zelensky is also surrounded by reformers, including Oleksandr Danyliuk, a respected former finance minister who clashed with Mr Kolomoisky, helping to nationalise his bank and then securing a freeze of his worldwide assets. 
The eccentricity of Ukrainian politics should not obscure some important achievements. Thanks to free media and genuine political competition, “this has been the freest and most peaceful election in Ukraine’s history,” says Alexander Martynenko, a commentator and the head of Interfax Ukraine, a news agency. Most important, the vote averted a split along linguistic, historical and ethnic lines long exploited both by the country’s own politicians and by the Kremlin, and has brought it closer together than it had been for years. Being Russian-speaking and pro-Ukrainian, Mr Zelensky covered most of the country, with the exception of the eastern and western peripheries. 
He lacks a core electorate, but managed to mobilise the urban lower-middle class—traders, taxi-drivers, craftsmen—who rarely vote. Many of these people stayed at home watching TV during the Maidan “revolution of dignity”. But although Mr Zelensky himself is no revolutionary and even made jokes about it, he is the latest manifestation of a historic process that Maidan set off. He and his team are very different from the political class that has milked Soviet-era resources over past decades. Now they have a second round to win, and a lot of expectations to live up to.
