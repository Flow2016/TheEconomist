# Why are Northern Ireland’s prisons so empty?

NORTHERN IRELAND’S prisons were once notorious. They were battlegrounds of the “Troubles” of 1968-98, as the government experimented with internment without trial and prisoners demanded recognition of their political status with “dirty protests”, during which some smeared excrement on cell walls. The gaunt features of Bobby Sands, a Republican inmate, became well known as he starved himself to death in 1981. The Irish Republican Army targeted warders. “People had assumptions about who we were,” says Austin Treacy, the province’s director of prisons. “And during the Troubles, we didn’t want them to know who we were.” 
Yet Mr Treacy and his colleagues now have something to boast about. A much smaller share of the population serves time than in England, Wales or Scotland (see chart). Its incarceration rate is closer to that of countries championed by penal reformers such as Norway and Sweden than it is to the rest of the UK. English prisons are crammed but there is plenty of room to spare in jails across the Irish Sea. The disparity seems counterintuitive, given the relatively recent conflict and evidence suggesting that the province’s judges are no less likely to impose custodial sentences than those elsewhere in the UK.

Three factors help explain the gap. The first is a gulf in crime rates. Surveys suggest Northern Irish people are a little more than half as likely to fall victim to crime as those in England and Wales. Some think the higher number of cops relative to population in the province has a deterrent effect. Others, including Mr Treacy, point to the lack of big cities, which tend to have concentrations of crime. 
Second, the Northern Irish system is better at deterring prisoners from reoffending once they are released. On March 28th Dame Glenys Stacey, the chief inspector of probation in England and Wales, concluded that the part-privatisation of its system in 2014 was “irredeemably flawed”. All of the 10 private probation firms inspected last year were given the lowest two of four grades. By contrast Northern Ireland kept its unified, public-sector system. Olwen Lyner of NIACRO, a criminal-justice charity, adds that having one probation agency and a single police force (rather than the 43 in England and Wales) makes it easier to co-ordinate support for ex-prisoners. 
Even the much-criticised prisons are beginning to play a part. After inspectors rebuked HMP Maghaberry in 2015 partly for failing to provide enough activities for inmates, officers opened a recycling plant to train inmates and a café where prisoners do the serving. They rebranded the only jail for young offenders as a “secure college”, where staff call prisoners, who study educational and vocational courses, “students”. It is too early to judge the lasting effects of the changes, but Mr Treacy claims they are bearing fruit. Prisoners are becoming less likely to reoffend, and the overall recidivism rate is ten percentage points lower than in England and Wales. 
The final explanation is historical—and disturbing. During the Troubles, paramilitaries ran a shadow justice system to police their neighbourhoods. Their influence is waning but they still enforce a strict “moral code” in some working-class districts, says John Topping of Queen’s University Belfast. Several dozen “punishment assaults” are recorded by police every year, to enforce drug debts but also for suspected criminal offences that may otherwise be reported to the police. Victims are shot in the knees or roughed up with baseball bats. 
In an attempt to end this violence, the state licenses grassroots alternatives to the justice system. One group, Community Restorative Justice Ireland, is run by Harry Maguire, a Republican who served ten years in jail for his part in the murder of two British soldiers. It claims to handle 1,700 or so disputes a year, mostly between Republicans. It refers serious crimes to the police, but otherwise mediates between parties involved in low-level wrongdoing or to prevent family feuds escalating. 
The groups break cycles of offending and keep young people in particular out of prison, says Phil Scraton, also of Queen’s. As they are subject to inspection, they offer a more legitimate form of informal justice, argues David Ford, a former justice minister at Stormont. But their sectarian nature means they are hardly ideal models. “Would you do it in England and Wales? Probably not,” Mr Ford admits.
