##### Compromises are often unsatisfactory to all

IT WAS PERHAPS fitting that this week’s Commons debates on Brexit were interrupted by a protest by 12 semi-naked people. MPs tried hard to ignore the invaders even as several glued their bottoms against the glass barrier above the chamber. In line with a surreal atmosphere of repetitious argument, the protest was not even about Brexit, but climate change. 
This was far from the high point of the week’s drama. That came a day later when Theresa May emerged from a seven-hour cabinet meeting to announce that, to break the Brexit logjam, she would now try to agree a plan with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Even more important, she added that, if this effort failed, she would bind herself to implement whatever Brexit proposal MPs agreed upon in their next round of voting. 
The prime minister’s volte-face comes at a crucial moment. For months she has been advised that, because she would never get all hardline Brexiteers in the Tory European Research Group (ERG) and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to back the Brexit deal she has done with the European Union, she must reach out to the opposition. Now she has belatedly accepted this advice. In doing so, she has tilted firmly against a no-deal Brexit. To invert her mantra, she now seems to think any deal is better than no-deal. Tory hardliners are furious with her (see Bagehot). 
Even so, it is not obvious that her move will bear fruit. The two leaders, who met on the afternoon of April 3rd, are not just far apart politically but also notoriously intransigent. Mrs May might soften some Brexit “red lines”, but she is still opposed to both the customs union and the single market. Mr Corbyn wants to pursue the first, and many elements of the second. He is also under pressure from his party to press for a second referendum, but she has been determinedly against this. Any Brexit deal must also espouse the current withdrawal agreement, including the contentious Irish backstop that implicitly relies on a customs union and regulatory alignment as insurance against a hard border. 
It does not help that MPs keep showing what they are against, not what they are for. On March 29th, when Brexit was originally due to happen, MPs rejected Mrs May’s deal for a third time, albeit by the margin of 58 votes, down from the record previous defeats by 230 and 149. Then on April 1st MPs again rejected all Brexit options before them in a second round of “indicative votes”—though by less than before. A customs-union motion was rejected by just three votes; a confirmatory referendum by 12; and a “Norway-plus” option redubbed “Common Market 2.0” by 21 votes. 
The main reason why nothing gets through is that there is so little mood for compromise on any side. Hardliners in the ERG and the DUP voted against every option because they do not want in any way to soften the hard Brexit they favour. But firm Remainers were almost equally obdurate. They refused to back Common Market 2.0 because it would weaken their campaign for a second referendum. Deadlock in the Commons was symbolised by a tie in a procedural vote about more Brexit voting next week, though it is in practice still likely. 
Nick Boles, who sponsored Common Market 2.0, accused fellow Tories of refusing to compromise and announced his resignation from the party whip. He is right that the Tories were, along with the DUP, the most intransigent of all. Barely a sixth of Tory MPs backed any option in the indicative votes. He won over the Scottish Nationalists, yet the Liberal Democrats and the new Change UK party were also hostile to his plan. 
This aversion to compromise can only make Mrs May’s attempt to find one even harder. That is unfortunate for two big reasons. One is that Brexit requires trade-offs: between the health of the economy and the desire for greater sovereignty, and between unfettered access to the EU market and the wish to control free movement of people. Compromises are often unsatisfactory to all. A customs union, for example, would only reduce not eliminate border frictions (including in Northern Ireland). By making it impossible to offer third countries lower tariffs on their goods exports, it would also make it far harder to strike free-trade deals, though they could in theory be done for services alone. 
The second reason is the looming deadline, now April 12th. Usually when compromise fails, the status quo prevails. For Brexit, however, the default is leaving without a deal. This week the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, spelt out the consequences for ministers in gory detail. Prices would jump, the economy tip into recession and the nation’s security be imperilled. That is why MPs this week were trying to push through a law requiring Mrs May to seek another extension to the deadline. 
She has in fact promised to do just that at the European Council in Brussels on April 10th. But it is not a given that EU leaders, whose unanimous approval is needed for an extension, will agree. Several are fed up with Mrs May’s indecision and with British MPs’ failure to agree upon anything. Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, says the leaders are split, with France’s Emmanuel Macron inclined to be tougher on Mrs May than Germany’s Angela Merkel. 
Mr Grant adds that EU leaders will insist that, if Britain is still a member after May 22nd, which is likely even if Mrs May and Mr Corbyn miraculously compromise in the next few days, it must take part in the European Parliament elections due on May 23rd-26th. Mrs May is keen not to do this so as to avoid explaining to voters why such an election is happening almost three years after the Brexit referendum. But she was careful this week not to rule out the possibility, so in a crunch she will surely give way. The government is already making contingency plans to hold the election. 
However the next few days go, Mrs May once again faces torrid negotiations in Brussels next week. EU leaders are aware that she has lost control of her party and of Parliament. They know she has promised to quit as prime minister, and they are fearful of who might succeed her. Returning to that Commons protest, Aneurin Bevan famously warned the Labour Party that scrapping nuclear weapons would mean its foreign secretary walking naked into the conference chamber. Mrs May will not have to do that. But she has few weapons and even less credibility with which to lever more concessions from the EU.
