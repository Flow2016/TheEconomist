It was gratifying to read your leader on mental-health care (“Shrinks, expanded”, March 16th). But as far as Britain goes, people who work in this area are far from being “trained amateurs”. Many have a background in cognitive behavioural therapy and professional qualifications, including mental-health nursing, occupational therapy and so on. 
Also, psychiatrists and psychological therapists do a completely different job; the terms are not interchangeable. Psychiatrists are doctors and can prescribe medication. The vast majority of them are not qualified to provide talking therapy. To suggest that therapists provide a cheap alternative to psychiatrists is to show a fundamental misunderstanding of their respective roles and expertise.

Laypeople, such as teachers or bartenders, trained in psychological “first aid” can identify people with depression or anxiety, cheer them up and refer them to care services. However, such amateurs are not a new wonder-cure. People who suffer from depression also often misuse alcohol or drugs. They may have a hidden history of child abuse. They may have subtle personality disorders that cycles them back into social conflicts that lead to depression. 
A firefighter with a few weekends of training in basic cognitive behavioural techniques would never be capable of addressing such deeper issues. The “talking cure” is no exception to the maxim: you get what you pay for.

The only possible solution for providing evidence-based psychological treatment to everyone with anxiety and depression is self-guided or therapist-guided cognitive behaviour therapy over the internet. Numerous clinical trials have shown this to be effective and it now forms part of routine care in Australia, Canada, Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands. The effects compare well with trials of antidepressant medication, are enduring and far exceed natural remission. Moreover, the principles are universal and have been shown to work in Arabic and Chinese.

We are seeing an important push to destigmatise mental-health problems and raise awareness. The many people now coming forward probably indicates some unmet need. But we may also be convincing people that they are ill when they are not. 
The rise of social media and a cultural expectation of happiness, coupled with the lowering of some diagnostic thresholds, makes me question whether our services are overburdened with people who are facing some stress or negative emotions, which have been incorrectly pathologised and pushed into the realm of sickness. What are the consequences for individuals, for wider society, and our resilience, of over-medicalisation?

Following the Christchurch shooting, you made only tangential reference to social media, which is part of the core of today’s terrorism (“The new face of terror, much like the old”, March 23rd). Self regulation has failed with social-media companies. Carrying hate and terror content on media platforms should be criminalised, something along the lines of a code of conduct for social media. This would establish an international criminal jurisdiction with independent judges who have the power to impose fines on offending host countries and companies alike in the amount of billions of dollars, much like recent American bank fines. 
The reasons are that, first, compared with finance, social media’s aiding, abetting and facilitating terrorism is by far the greater crime. And second, only big fines have the capacity to threaten these companies with extinguishing their profit and share price. Only then will they change their conduct.

Your package on “The new scramble for Africa” (March 9th) shone a light on the demographic trends that make the continent a global player worthy of genuine partnership. But you underplayed the importance of Europe. The two continents are just 14km (8.5 miles) apart at their closest point. The European Union and its member states are Africa’s largest donors, supplying more than half the aid the continent receives. Africa exported twice the value of goods to the EU as it did to China in 2017. The EU and its member states have more embassies in the region than either superpower. 
However, Europe and Africa share something much more fundamental: a future dependent on one another. A genuine partnership of equals that prioritises mutual interests through rapid funding in education, health and infrastructure for Africa’s youth would contribute to global growth. Europe’s investment must be bolder in terms of financing, policy and governance reforms than what is currently on the table. The EU’s seven-year budget, being negotiated right now, is the time to grasp that opportunity.

You ran a “humorous” collection of snippets recalling all the broken Brexit promises (“Magical thinking”, March 30th). But you omitted David Cameron’s announcement on February 20th 2016, when he called the Brexit referendum. After recommending that Britain remain in what he laughingly described as a “reformed” European Union (and also pointing to the threat to the British economy if we left the single market) the then prime minister nevertheless went on to propose that “the British people decide our future in Europe” at the ballot box, specifically that “the choice is in your hands”. 
Or how about this other Brexit pledge, from the leaflet setting out the government’s official position, which was sent to every single British household ahead of the referendum. The government wanted Britain to remain in the EU, but the leaflet promised that this “once in a generation decision” was ours, and that “the government will implement what you decide”. 
We weighed up the facts and made that choice on June 23rd 2016. To leave the EU.

After reading about how disruptive technology may change the whiskey industry (“Going against the grain”, March 9th) I was reminded of a delightful short story by P.G. Wodehouse in his collection, “Meet Mr Mulliner”. 
Mr Mulliner’s brother, Wilfred, was “the clever one of the family”. His was “the brain which had electrified the world of science by discovering that if you mixed a stiffish oxygen and potassium and added a splash of trinitrotoluol and a spot of old brandy you got something that could be sold in America as champagne at a hundred and fifty dollars the case.”
