BECAUSE SHE liked recycling, in 2003 Agnès Varda built herself a shack. It was made of 35mm prints of “The Creatures”, her biggest flop, one of the very few in which she had cast a star, Catherine Deneuve. But when she sat inside this new construction the sunlight entered in the most beautiful ways, glowing through the images, so that she inhabited cinema. 
And she did inhabit it, not as a great feted director but as someone joyfully on the margins, a stout elf doing her own little thing in shapeless, often purple, clothes and with pudding-bowl two-tone hair; someone who couldn’t help making films, because the urge to look and listen never let go. In a car she would naturally hold her hand to the windscreen to frame the views and the passing cars. Behind a camera she would dart about as an eye would behave, resting for a while on a man reading a newspaper, then getting distracted by a bicycle, a picture on a wall, a child shouting. She had started as a photographer and went on taking stills all her life, but her eye was restless. The smaller cameras became, from 35mm to 16mm to hand-held digital, weaving up and down with her, the happier she was. She called her craft cinécriture, cine-writing, and hoped to be as radical in it as Joyce or Faulkner were in literature. 
For this some people called her the grandmother (or godmother) of French nouvelle vague, the embrace of realism and social consciousness, and thought her film “La Pointe Courte” of 1955, which she shot in her home town of Sète using mostly local fishermen, marked the start of it. But she began as a crazy innocent who had seen perhaps five films. She didn’t consort with François Truffaut or the others just as she didn’t mix with Hollywood later, despite an Oscar for lifetime achievement. Instead, since her films mostly made no money and she didn’t care, she sold DVDs of them to passers-by from an improvised place beside her ramshackle pink atelier in rue Daguerre in Paris. Just like the neighbour-shopkeepers in her first documentary, “Daguerréotypes”—the perfumier gently filling bottles of violet-water, the butcher wrapping meat, the baker stretching dough—she offered her produce where it was made. 
Documentaries pleased her as a schooling in modesty, just placing the camera to observe, not hovering like an eagle or overlaying ideas of her own. Another, “The Gleaners”, recorded the lives of the poor or frugal who picked up wasted food from thrown-out pallets or the ground, her hand-held camera bending with them to see what they found, rejoicing especially in a potato shaped like a heart. People often told her they had nothing to say, but she drew words out of them, gleaning herself. In “Faces, Places” in 2017 she travelled round rural France with JR, a maker of giant photographs, delighting to persuade shy overlooked folk to have their portraits posted briefly but grandly on walls and water-towers. 
Dignifying people, by recording part of the million tiny impulses and observations that made up their lives, was also something she did in her fiction films. In these she sometimes followed one actress, surrounded by non-actors, through a not-so-normal day: walking with Cléo, a singer with two hours to wait for a possible cancer diagnosis, through the streets of Paris in “Cléo from 5 to 7”, placing her fear of death against the beauty of ordinary life; or trudging in “The Vagabond” over tracks and frozen fields with a young woman, Mona, who had decided to abandon her job for the freedom of the open road, though it also meant derision and hunger and sordid trysts in her tent. Each time the camera was discreet and, when it was kinder to do so, gazed elsewhere. 
Social messages ran all through these films, but only one about America’s Black Panthers, and a collation of 4,000 black-and-white stills of the revolution she took in Cuba in 1963, proclaimed her left-wing convictions. Feminism was another matter. She was born a feminist, changing her name to sober Agnès from silly, giggly Arlette, signing a manifesto to legalise abortion in France and making films in which the patriarchy smothered even supper-table conversation. “Le Bonheur”, the tale of a handsome carpenter casually two-timing his wife, showed how women could be interchangeable to men; “Lions Love” told the story of a woman director pestered by studio executives; “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” explored the growth of a friendship between two girls, one needing an abortion, one helping to pay. She filmed Jane Birkin’s ogled body and the imprisoned caryatids of Paris. Her husband, Jacques Demy, maker of “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg”, was an exception, a treasure, for whom she made a trilogy of films after his death. They began with the small Jacques creating a camera out of cardboard to frame a scene and focus on things, just like her. 
Her own girlhood was spent on a moored boat at Sète, catching sticklebacks from the quay and playing on the sands of the Grande Plage. If, as she believed, people were full of landscapes, then she was full of beaches, and waves played in her all the time. In “The Beaches of Agnès”, made in 2008, she wandered on various shores with acrobats and friends. In three stills she summed it up: quiet, foam, sand. On her 90th birthday, she swam in the sea. 
By this time she had turned many film prints into miniature glowing shacks, and one into a little boat. Like the sea, they showed how ephemeral everything was that her eye saw and the camera recorded. All those memories and realisations that made up her life would fade away unless she kept voyaging through new landscapes, meeting new people, looking and listening and constantly rebuilding the world out of sheer curiosity.
