ZACH SERBER worked at Amyris, a synthetic-biology pioneer, when the company was trying to crack the biofuel market. Seeing brilliant metabolic engineering fail to make a business led him and his co-founders at Zymergen, a company based in Emeryville, California, to take their new company in a different direction. They would not try to manufacture or sell things. They would offer their synthetic biology as a way of making businesses already using biotechnology more profitable. This is, at the moment, the model used by a number of leading synthetic-biology companies. At its heart is the automation of experiment. 
Biotechnology is already a bigger business than many people realise. Rob Carlson of Bioeconomy Capital, an investment company, calculates that money made from creatures which have been genetically engineered accounted for about 2% of American GDP in 2017. The contribution was split between three industries. Pharmaceuticals and crops, contributing $137bn and $104bn respectively, are the ones that the public knows about. The third sector, industrial biotechnology, is much less visible but even more lucrative, worth $147bn or more (see chart). Chemicals used for many purposes—raw materials for plastics, food additives, some fragrances and biofuels—are already being churned out at scale by altered micro-organisms in fermentation tanks. 
As well as being the biggest biotechnology market, this is also the one best suited to companies seeking to offer innovation as a service. Testing drugs and genetically modified crops is a long and costly business. Replacing one strain of industrial yeast with a better one can be done in a week. Industrial customers tend to know what they want and synthetic biology promises a lot of value. Tim Fell, the boss of Synthace, a synthetic-biology software company in London, says that in one project the company engineered a 200-fold increase in the rate at which bacteria produced something useful (he cannot say what) in just four weeks.

About 75% of Zymergen’s business, according to Dr Serber, is helping companies re-engineer, for industrial purposes, microbes they are already using, in order to increase production, reduce costs or both. The company is built around machine-learning programs that suggest changes to the genome which could produce an organism and setting—temperature, nutrient balance, and so on—that improves on the status quo. In this fiercely empirical process Zymergen makes DNA tweaks of all sorts, most of them to sequences that regulate gene expression. These tweaks, says Dr Serber, have helped customers for its “molecular technology” make better margins on hundreds of thousands of tonnes of product. 
Arzeda, based in the Interbay district of Seattle, has a similar business model and is based on similar technologies. But where Zymergen concentrates on empirically derived ways to improve productivity, the expertise of Arzeda’s machine-learning systems and scientists is in applying a theoretical understanding of how the shape into which proteins fold determines their function, thus making them better at what they do, or able to do something new. It brands itself “the protein design company”. 
Ginkgo, the iGEM-born startup in Boston, is another variation on the business-to-business theme. Its focus is not on the specifics of genome-based machine-learning or protein design, though it does both, so much as on developing a broader expertise in the remaking of microbes. It calls itself “the organism company”. 
The three companies may differ in details of their approaches, but the big picture unites them. All of them see their current business-to-business approach as a stepping stone, a way of honing their techniques, teaching their machine-learning programs and bringing in cash as they develop products of their own. Arzeda talks of making tulipin, which among other things can greatly improve the qualities of perspex. That improvement is not so great as to justify harvesting it from its native tulips, but Arveda’s proteins mean you do not need to. Ginkgo is spinning out joint ventures with clients to work in specific areas. In 2018 it created a business with Bayer, a chemical company, to develop microbes which would make fertiliser inside a plant’s root system. It has another spin-out working on cannabis, and has just announced a third one developing plant proteins for use in vegetarian foods, including meat substitutes. Zymergen is looking at materials for electronics. 
They are also united in their zeal for high-throughput experiments. Their use of massive amounts of synthesised DNA is producing a new way of doing biology on an industrial scale 
During the five years that Jason Kelly, Ginkgo’s chief executive, spent in Dr Endy’s lab at MIT in the 2000s he reckons he may have ordered 50,000 bases of commercially synthesised DNA—a pretty profligate amount at the time. Today Ginkgo orders synthetic DNA sequences at 50,000 times that rate, using them to change the genomes of thousands of organisms a day. In 2017 it bought a DNA-synthesis company, Gen9, bringing all its production capacity in-house. That has not sated its appetite. It has a contract with Twist Bioscience, the world’s biggest DNA-synthesis company, for a billion base pairs over the coming years. 
Arzeda is smaller, but Alexandre Zanghellini, its boss, says it still manages to order around 10,000 new DNA sequences a week, each of which is then put into a particular microbe so that its computers’ assumptions about how changes in the sequence change the function of proteins can be tested. Often these DNA sequences are not even looked at by humans before they arrive by courier. 
Drinking from such a firehose of DNA increasingly requires experiments designed and managed by computers. Ginkgo spent years programming computers to supervise experiments and robots to carry them out and then finding and removing the innumerable bugs with which those programs were afflicted. For ten years, according to Dr Kelly, doing lab work using the partially automated foundries thus created was considerably slower for the company’s designers than doing it themselves would have been. But having to use the automated systems meant having to improve them. A couple of years ago, Dr Kelly says, Ginkgo reached a point where its foundries were as productive, in terms of person hours for work done, as an expert researcher. Now he pegs them as ten times more productive, and says the margin is growing. 
Automation increases not just the amount of research that can be done, but also its complexity. Much biological experimentation takes place in trays of 96 “microwells”, or miniature test tubes. Humans tend to design experiments using these wells quite simply; do A to one subset, B to another, and so on. A computer can design experimental strategies that are much more complex, picking a wider range of hypotheses to test, and then testing many more hypotheses per tray. For properly programmed robot flunkies, the most recondite experimental schemes are a doddle. According to Markus Gershater, the chief scientific officer at Synthace, the gains software and automation offer experimental design can be just as important as gains in speed and throughput. 
The role of machine learning in these labs means they have an enormous appetite for data. Most biology labs do without mass spectrometers, analytic tools which rapidly sort through samples molecule by molecule and characterise every one of them. They are expensive and produce more data than most people need. Synthetic-biology companies love them. 
More data offer computers a clearer idea of what is going on; they also show what is going wrong. Most biologists at the bench have a sense that the living material they work with is not really to be trusted. Biology, they say, unlike physics, is unreliable. The “noise” in experiments can often swamp the signal you are looking for. Getting an experiment to work pretty regularly is good enough. In part this may be true. But it is hard not to think that much of the unreliability is with the biologists, not the biology. How else to explain why studies repeatedly find that many results reported in research papers cannot be replicated in other labs? 
The problem is not just human error. It is also human nescience. There are things going on in a lab that experimenters do not notice, but the creatures they experiment on do. The more data a system gathers, the more can be discovered, if necessary, about what actually happened, and that will surely help replicability. 
Industrialisation helps in other ways, too. One piece of kit popular in labs that can afford it is the Echo 655, built by Labcyte. Like a pipetting system it moves drops of fluid from one set of wells to another. But by creating those drops with tightly focused ultrasound rather than suction it does so in much smaller amounts, much more accurately and with no contaminating contact. Smaller wells—up to 1,536 on a tray—mean more throughput and less spent on the chemical reagents the experiments use up. At the far end of this trend towards the tiny and precise is a system made by a startup called Berkeley Lights which has wells which contain but a single cell, manipulated entirely with laser beams. 
So powerful is this new automation that it has drawn Synthace away from its original intention of making organisms to providing software as a service instead. The company has developed a computing environment called Antha, where researchers can say what they want done in relatively high-level terms, confident that machines will optimise the experiment’s design for the client’s instruments and tell the instruments what to do. 
A startup called Transcriptic wants to go even further, operating “labs in the cloud” where an experimenter at a terminal anywhere in the world can get a set of experiments done in an automated facility they never even see. Mr Kelly thinks that, at least for the sort of work Ginkgo does, the time is not yet right for such radical approaches—having the people designing the organisms and the foundries that make them under one roof matters a lot. But it is clear that the trend to automation is not yet played out. 
From the ratcheting of the ribosome on up, there is something mechanical about life. In foundries like Ginkgo’s it is hard to avoid the sense of that mechanistic model moving out from the cells embodying it and into the sparsely inhabited systems studying, manipulating and redesigning them. There is an uncanny feedback loop between the machineries of cell and laboratory which is eating away at the gap in between them.
