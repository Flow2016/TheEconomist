THOSE GIVEN to grand statements about the future often proclaim this to be the century of biology in the same way that the 20th century was that of physics and the 19th was the century of chemistry. Synthetic biology’s potential provides a basis for such boosterism; life reprogrammed to produce useful new products, take new forms and act in helpful ways. 
Honouring that promise will not be easy. Understanding biology’s capacity to process information, and thus control itself, is a much more challenging puzzle than mastering the parcelled world of software and hardware. Taking years to create a working AND gate is therapeutically very promising. But it is a very small step on the way to controlling life as a coder controls a computer. 
Still, the fact that synthetic biology recapitulates some early aspects of the computer revolution should not lead people to ignore crucial differences. One is that those who created the modern world of computers did not have powerful computers to help them in their task. Today’s synthetic biologists do. Their work builds on, and grows out of, the computer revolution, and this may speed it up a lot. Frances Arnold of Caltech compares life’s programming to a symphony composed by evolution, and today’s biology by design as being roughly at the level of learning to hold the composer’s pencil. That is why she likes to harness evolution to remake things, rather than design from scratch. But it is evolution that is guided with machine learning and directed by human creativity to write songs that humans want. 
People have imagined such things before. In the early 20th century scientists and writers inspired by the new power of genetics described “biotopias” eerily reminiscent of the dreams of synthetic biology. In H.G. Wells’s “Men Like Gods” (1923) plants “had been trained and bred to make new and unprecedented secretions, waxes, gums, essential oils and the like, of the most desirable quality”, which could serve as a slightly flowery mission statement for half the companies in this TQ. In Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “Herland” (1915), a race of parthenogenetic women live in a cornucopian Eden they have fashioned through science to meet their every need. 
As Jim Endersby, a historian, points out, some aspects of these biotopias shock modern sensibilities. For one thing, their inhabitants engineer themselves, as well as their environments, in a way that eugenicists like Wells saw as entirely unproblematic. It was the treatment of people as means not ends in this way that Aldous Huxley rebelled against in his own contribution to the genre, “Brave New World”(1932). Synthetic biology will certainly get caught up in the post-eugenic discussions of such matters that CRISPR has brought to the fore today. 
Other now-alien attitudes in those early biotopias also throw light on today’s arguments. Wells and Gilman saw no problem with deliberately exterminating species; it was a reasonable, even natural, imposition of beneficial order. Today such possibilities are being discussed for real, but with a lot less equanimity. “Gene drives”—genetic systems which, seemingly paradoxically, use sexual transmission to spread sterility—offer a way that CRISPRtechnologies might be used to try to wipe out disease vectors, such as the species of mosquito that spread malaria. 
Some look at a death toll of hundreds of thousands of people a year and see in this an elegant solution; there are plenty of non-malarial species of mosquito around to pick up any ecological slack. Others ask by what right they might bring an extinction about, what risks they would expose other less dispensable insects to and what sort of informed consent they might possibly get. Steered by this discussion, research on gene drives—funded by, among others, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—is increasingly, and wisely, focused on ways to break chains of transmission by crashing mosquito populations locally and temporarily, rather than globally, for ever. Insect populations so depleted that there are no longer enough to feed the summer swallows—a feature of Wells’s biotopia—is the sort of problem synthetic biologists talk of putting right by cutting back on the need for pesticides, not something they would seek to engineer. 
It is not just that today’s biotopians are averse to extinctions. Some talk of reversing them—of using the tools of their trade to bring back the passenger pigeon, the great auk, the woolly mammoth, the American chestnut and others. Genomes preserved in museums or permafrost can be sequenced, and the genomes found in related species reprogrammed to produce something similar. In a small gesture in this direction, Ginkgo has made a scent that smells of a type of hibiscus that is now extinct. 
This idea, too, meets with scepticism, even repugnance. Some feel that the results would be a Potemkin creation—new creatures that preserve a mere semblance of what has been lost, rather than restoring its essence. Some environmentalists also see it as a grotesque caricature of a problem that their movement has long suffered from: concentrating on a few high-profile species while ignoring the wholesale destruction of others that are less glamorous. But a recent report commissioned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that conservation does need new tools, and synthetic biology offers opportunities in that respect—while also bringing with it risks, both direct and indirect, that need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and in a precautionary way. Some conservationists are keen to see how well gene drives can wipe out invasive species on islands. 
That tools so radical might be used to conserve or preserve, not disrupt, might seem a bit of a contradiction—even perverse. But it is worth considering that the changes wrought by synthetic biology could refashion humankind’s relationship with the natural world at a technical and conceptual level and at the same time bring little dislocation to everyday life. As Kelly and Zach Weinersmith put it in their book “Soonish”, synthetic biology may be “like Frankenstein, except the monster spends the whole book dutifully making medicine and industrial inputs”. 
At a “Build-a-Cell” workshop in San Diego this February the assembled researchers noted how hard it was to communicate to the public the remarkable scope of their ambitions: creating genomes and the cells to house them from almost first principles. If you appreciate the conceptual bravura of an organism with no ancestors, or that even discussing such a thing would have seemed insane just 25 years ago, this is staggering. If you do not, such synthetic life seems just to be, well, more life. And life is both already a miracle and the most everyday one. Cell is a cell is a cell. 
It may be that the public is on to something. The application of genetic technology to human health and enhancement will be hotly debated. So will worries about how such technologies can be kept out of dangerous hands. But the fundamental change in the relation of the human and the natural may not seem so dramatic. 
Consider the Colombian exchange. Shuffling together the ecosystems of the New World and the Old was a huge event in terms of both biology and human history. It wiped out populations and overhauled ways of life. But today an Indian cooking with chilli, or a German smoking a pipe of tobacco, or a Mexican admiring a mustang running free give little thought to the alien biology they are using and appreciating. Synthetic biology’s innovations may be similarly woven into the background of the world, but without the concomitant suffering. 
Even the most gentle transformation in the relationship between people and nature, though, may bring harm to some. Interacting with nature is often something the poorest depend on most. If synthetic biology replaces prized natural products with cheaper artificial ones, it will break ties to nature that are both meaningful and economically important, particularly in the developing world. 
Take vanilla pods. The key flavour molecule in vanilla is already synthesised by chemists. Vanilla pods, though, contain a range of related molecules which provides something richer and consumers value them for that reason. Now synthetic biology might match or surpass nature’s subtlety. So Dr Endy, now at Stanford, expected remonstration when he met a Mexican vanilla farmer at a synthetic-biology discussion. Instead, he found a man enthused. Vanilla was not just his livelihood but also a cause for ceremony, a provider of solace, a source of stories. And synthetic biology used properly, he thought, would not replace it as such, but could instead enhance it. It could bring new subtleties to valued scents, welcome strangeness to a well-loved story. The connection between people and plant might be deepened, not displaced. 
It is easy to assume that reprogrammed life is a lesser life, innately commercial and desacrilised—that as the machineries of cell and laboratory become ever more tightly bound, they will squeeze out something that is human, or natural, or both, which ought to sit in the space between them. But it is also possible that a new appreciation can grow out of that space, a sense of what life is and could be, extended and enriched by new understanding. Think of it as a tune not yet composed, or the catnip scent of a lost flower reimagined and smelled, as if blooming for the first time.
