BIOLOGY IS A way of structuring matter at a molecular scale by slotting each atom into its needful place. It is a way of controlling flows of energy on every scale from that of the smallest living cell to that of the whole living planet. It is a way of growing order and surprise in a universe that in all other respects tends towards entropic stagnation. And it is a thicket of limits on how long lives can last and how much life can accomplish. 
It is also a way of packing 3,500 excited young people into the Hynes Convention Centre in Boston, Massachusetts. More than 300 teams from 42 countries took part in the annual International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition there last October. By encouraging such teams to co-operate and compete in its Grand Jamboree, the iGEM foundation is hoping to create a framework for a synthetic-biology industry which combines molecular biology and engineering to achieve specific goals. Over the summer the young people went from an idea about something biological that might meet a human need, to designing new genes and seeing how well their ideas worked. 
The projects presented to judges and peers at iGEM covered a remarkable range. There was an attempt to give bacteria a human sense of smell; there were fungi that could be used to build bases on Mars. The Great Bay team of Chinese high-school students won an award for synthesising the active ingredient of catnip in yeast and bacteria; they think it may help programmes which round up stray cats. Post graduates at the University of Marburg won an award for new genetic tools that will make a very fast-growing bacterium, Vibrio natriegens, easier for other engineers to use. 
Not all iGEM projects pan out; one of the things teams learn is that, though engineering organisms is now possible, it is still difficult. Life can be very recalcitrant. Even so, there are already 32 startups around the world that began life as iGEM teams. Ginkgo Bioworks, a firm which grew out of teams from MIT that competed in 2004 and 2006, builds new organisms for clients in agriculture and the chemicals industry at an astonishing rate in its labs on the other side of Boston. It has attracted $429m of investment. 
However, the Grand Jamboree is not primarily a route to riches. It is a celebration, and an exploration, of technology that will, in time, change the living world far beyond the test tube. Human engineering of the inanimate has produced a range of wonders from cities of towering glass to the fused sand that sits at the heart of computers. It is entirely plausible that engineering the animate could produce wonders as great and as various—and as unimaginable today as skyscrapers and silicon chips were 200 years ago. 
Humans have been turning biology to their own purposes for more than 10,000 years. They have reshaped crops and livestock through selective breeding and changed the structure of ecosystems by moving species around—most notably in the “Columbian exchange” that mixed together the fauna and flora of the New World and the Old. Having learned, in the 1950s, that genes were written on long molecules of DNA like stock prices on tickertape, by the 1970s scientists were able to start to move traits from organisms in which they evolved to organisms in which they could be useful by cutting and pasting pieces of that tickertape. That ability became the basis of the biotechnology industry. 
The key enabling technology for synthetic biology is the ability to write new chemical messages on to fresh bits of tickertape, rather than just move nature’s old messages from genome to genome. Machines capable of synthesising DNA letter by letter started to appear in the late 1980s. A decade later there were companies offering to write out almost any sequence of DNA letters you asked for and courier them straight to you. No longer limited by the genes they found in nature, biologists were able to get cells to work in whole new ways—to reprogram them. 
That new ability underlay the three turn-of-the-century academic trends which came together to form synthetic biology. One of these was centred on engineers at MIT who had, from the 1960s to 1980s, pioneered the computer and internet revolutions. The plummeting price of DNA-sequencing technology—machines that have only to read, as opposed to write, the tickertape of life, and thus work a lot faster—made it obvious to them that biology, like computing, was based on digital code and capable of making progress at exponential speeds. From this they concluded that cells could, in principle, be engineered in the same way that circuits and software are. 
Programming in nature is extremely convoluted, having evolved with no intention or guidance. And there is no helpful manual. But if you could synthesise genes that provided new, simpler ways of doing things, you would be liberated from having to understand the old ones. Life could be transformed into something more amenable to an engineering approach, with well-defined standardised parts. Tom Knight, one of the pioneers at MIT, and his colleagues saw in this sort of biological engineering something similarly world-changing to their work on the early internet and pre-PC computer workstations. And they found a generation of eager students whose first great “wow” moment in the cinema had been the re-engineered dinosaurs of “Jurassic Park”. 
The second ingredient that went into synthetic biology came from academics who were thinking along similar lines in the opposite direction; instead of trying to work round natural mechanisms they wanted to work towards recreating them. They were particularly interested in the systems by which cells turn genes on and off. Only when a gene is on, or “expressed”, will a cell make the protein described by that gene’s tickertape sequence. When it is turned off, or “repressed”, the protein’s production stops. Because proteins are the molecules that carry out almost all the tasks that go on in a cell, which genes are expressed when is fundamental to how cells work—and to how a brain cell, say, differs from a muscle cell, or a cancer cell from a healthy one. 
In 2000 two teams published designs for novel genetic “circuits” with which they could control the expression of one gene with a protein made by another. In one of the gene circuits the carefully fashioned genetic switches flicked each other on and off over time. Genetic circuitry like this “repressilator” was child’s play compared with the co-ordinated gene expression that evolution has programmed into leaves and eyes. But as one of the creators of the repressilator suggested, perhaps with Richard Dawkins’s metaphor of evolution as a blind watchmaker in mind, “at this stage one can learn more by putting together a simple if inaccurate pendulum clock than one can by disassembling the finest Swiss timepiece.” 
The third ingredient was more practical: metabolic engineering. Life uses proteins called enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions, to build all the other molecules it needs, with a different enzyme for each step of the construction. Sometimes the end product of such a metabolic pathway is something humans have a use for, such as a hormone, an antibiotic or a pesticide. 
Being able to write DNA from scratch allowed metabolic engineers to bring together genes from a number of different organisms to build new pathways, thus offering the prospect of making molecules beyond the reach of chemistry for less than the cost of harvesting them from plants. The most striking project, led by Jay Keasling, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, was a pathway which created a precursor to artemisinin, a molecule made by a plant called Chinese sweet wormwood that had been discovered to be a very good malaria drug. It was impossible to make the molecule by other means. 
As DNA synthesis became more widely available in the early 2000s, the various ways it could engineer new capabilities into organisms came together. By 2002 engineering undergraduates at MIT were using genes bought online to transform bacteria. In 2003 Dr Keasling and colleagues founded a company, Amyris, with an eye to making artemisinin and other useful stuff. The first international conference on synthetic biology took place at MIT the following year, a few months before the first iGEM Jamboree. 
The media got wind of the excitement. It was not just that synthetic biology seemed like the sort of thing from which weapons could be made. Scientists playing God is always good copy, even if the creations were, as yet, mostly microbes. Rarely has science offered such a heady scent of Goddishness—with forbidden-fruit undertones of Frankenstein and Faust—and raised so many ethical dilemmas. Drew Endy, a charismatic young leader in the MIT group, talked of “reimplementing life in a manner of our choosing” and shaking off the constraints of evolution. George Church of Harvard talked of synthesising not just genes but whole genomes, including, perhaps, those of creatures now extinct. The mammoth might return. 
Amid all this revolutionary talk, young companies in the field made a fateful decision to plunge into biofuels. It seemed a noble undertaking: biofuels could usher in the new technology of life while making good the damage done by the old technology of industrial machines. And governments were keen to subsidise them. But scaling up the pathways that produced hydrocarbons by the gram in the lab to the scale of millions of litres proved even more difficult than expected. The capital expense was huge. Worse, the oil price fell steeply. The projects failed. 
That made investors very cautious about synthetic biology. But the field attracted a bit of support from some governments, such as those of Britain and Singapore. In America the Pentagon’s far-out-ideas department, DARPA, which had taken an early interest, created a new office of biology in 2013. Two years later it launched a programme that paid for leading laboratories in the field to put together pathways which could produce 1,000 molecules never created biologically before. 
In January 2019 the 1,000th of those molecules was made. It seems an auspicious omen. In the past few years synthetic biology has shown signs of starting to live up to its promise. In part this is because of sustained academic effort and its cumulative gains; in part it is a matter of startup companies in the field finding their feet. But other factors are at play, too. 
One was new gene-editing technologies—ways of doctoring existing tickertape a letter at a time. In 2000 there was none; now there is a whole range, and those based on a molecule called CRISPR have proved particularly powerful and easy to use (it was a big part of the Marburg team’s victorious iGEM project). This has breathed new life into the idea of making precise changes to genomes, which is what synthetic biology is all about. It has opened new fields for biological research and new investors’ wallets (see chart). 
![image](images/20190406_TQC562_1.png) 
No one saw CRISPR coming. The falling cost of DNA synthesis, on the other hand, was widely foreseen. But it has still been a dramatic enabler. The price of a gene synthesised to order is about a thousandth of what it was in 2000; if you buy in bulk or have the technology in-house it can cost a lot less. 
And then there is machine learning. Synthetic biology gets even greater benefits than most other industries from the recent growth in the capabilities of pattern-recognition programs. It is not just that laboratories produce reams of data with which to train such programs. In a paper in 2005 Dr Endy noted that “the designs of natural biological systems are not optimised by evolution for the purposes of human understanding.” That is a problem for humans interpreting data and asking questions. For machines, though, understanding is as unnecessary as it is impossible. They just find patterns and uncover rules. This is not science as scientists understand it. But, if rigorously tested, such rules can still be a basis for engineering. There were perfectly good rules for building bridges long before there was a theory of gravity. 
While synthetic biology has grown more capable, the promise of two older approaches to the improvement of life has diminished. One, the pharmaceutical industry, seems bound by Eroom’s law (Moore’s law backwards); the number of new drugs developed per billion dollars of R&D spending falls remorselessly. It was ten in 1970. It is well under one today, and still dropping. 
This has excited interest in fundamentally new approaches to medicine. One is reprogramming cells to do helpful therapeutic things. Immune-system cells are the most obvious candidates. The cells of the microbiome—the interlinked bacterial ecosystems that thrive on skin and in guts—are another possibility. 
The second ailing improver of life is the petrochemical industry. Synthetic biology’s push into biofuels was not fundamentally misguided; fossil hydrocarbons do have to be replaced. The mistake was rushing into a bulk market with low margins: petrol. Some companies are now using synthetic biology to replace more upmarket molecules from the same crude oil which end up in fragrances and food additives with far more added value. Others are looking at making plastics environmentally friendly. As their technologies prove themselves at increasing scales, and as their technical prowess allows them to expand their repertoire to cheaper bulk products, these efforts could eat the petrochemical industry from within like some world-saving parasitic wasp. 
Synthetic-biology executives say their worry is not money, but focus and time. Every firm has more revolutionary-looking projects than it can pursue. And no one knows how long it will take the projects to pay off. As the gnomic aphorism at the end of Mr Endy’s emails has it: “Our victory inevitable. Our timing uncertain”.
