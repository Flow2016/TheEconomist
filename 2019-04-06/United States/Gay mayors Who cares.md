IT MADE FOR an awkward first-date conversation. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend in Indiana, recalls that he and Chasten Glezman talked about how he would be seeking higher political office. How would his boyfriend-to-be—now husband—feel about the public scrutiny? And how might voters respond to a same-sex couple on the campaign trail? 
Mr Buttigieg had an inkling voters would mostly shrug. He had been nervous about coming out as the incumbent mayor in 2015, but he went on to win re-election that year with 80% of the vote. In South Bend even conservatives and Catholics cared more about his efforts to revive a once-struggling industrial city or his spell soldiering in Afghanistan. Almost the only time his sexual orientation now gets mentioned, he says, is when somebody wants to tell him they are at ease with it. Attitudes to once controversial issues can flip from bold to normal with baffling speed, he says. 
The 37-year-old mayor is testing that notion nationally, trying a long-shot run to become the Democrats’ presidential candidate. He raised $7m in the past quarter, a decent sum that should place him among the more serious contenders in a crowded field. He reckons his identity, as “young, out, from the Midwest” helps win initial interest, then voters will judge him on his skill as a speaker and his ideas. 
It is much the same story in Chicago, where Lori Lightfoot, a 56-year-old African-American woman married to another woman, won a landslide victory in a run-off election to become mayor on April 2nd. “I’m an out lesbian, married with a child, running in this city, the first to ever make the ballot from the LGBTQ community,” she says. Recalling her arrival in Chicago in the 1980s, she says such a thing was “not even remotely possible back in those days.” 
Her mayoral campaign saw tense moments. In one debate her opponent, Toni Preckwinkle, praised her openness about her sexuality, a comment that sounded like a dogwhistle intended to deter more conservative African-American voters. Leaflets also appeared outside black churches warning that Ms Lightfoot would oversee a gay cabal in city hall. But voters again mostly shrugged. More appeared interested in her positioning as an outsider, promises to tackle corruption and her pledge to cut police violence. 
As mayor of America’s third-largest city she can help to shift perceptions of gay politicians some more. Annise Parker was mayor of Houston from 2010 to 2016 and now leads the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which helps to advise other out politicians. She praises Ms Lightfoot’s disciplined campaign and expects the success will further move “the national imagination”, deepening acceptance of gay politicians and giving the city something to cheer. She says Houston came to be seen as more diverse, open and appealing after voters repeatedly elected her to various posts. 
Gay politicians are growing unexceptional. Colorado has a gay governor, Jared Polis, and Oregon has a lesbian one, Kate Brown. Ms Parker estimates there are roughly 700 openly gay public officials nationally, including two senators and eight members of Congress (all of them Democrats). The Victory Fund endorsed 274 candidates in November’s elections. Of these, Ms Parker says, only five were Republicans (and all five lost). 
Americans have had 45 years to get used to gay people in public office. Kathy Kozachenko, a student in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was the first successful gay candidate anywhere, winning a city council seat in April 1974. But opinion has shifted quickly more recently, along with popular acceptance of gay marriage. It amounts to a quiet, welcome and probably irreversible turn in social attitudes. 
The Pew Research Centre found nearly half (46%) of Americans were still put off by a candidate known to be gay in 2007, but that fell to just 26% by 2016 and is probably lower now. Younger voters are least bothered. Among Democrats, Republicans and members of every large religious group (other than evangelicals), a majority of respondents said a candidate’s sexual orientation is irrelevant. For some it might be an asset. Mr Buttigieg, for example, might struggle harder to get a sympathetic hearing from some progressive voters if he were merely white, male, highly educated and a former management consultant. 
Why have attitudes changed? The AIDS crisis in the 1980s forced many gay men to come out. Then, as laws ended discrimination, more felt ready to do the same. Once most people realised they personally knew someone who was gay, they grew less likely to object to gay politicians. Jonathan Rauch of the Brookings Institution (and a former Economist writer) says gay activists started by demanding equal rights from the 1970s, and then from the 1990s also sought equal responsibilities, such as the chance to serve in the armed forces, marry and become parents. That process, he says, led to the triumph of an “assimilationist” model, in which gay people are accepted by others as fitting into an existing social order, rather than seen as trying to up-end it. 
Mr Rauch cheers politicians who are open about their orientation, but not defined by it. Renewed hostility is possible. President Donald Trump has hounded transgender people, for example in ordering them out of the armed forces. But even he has not criticised openly gay politicians. The political space open to Mr Buttigieg and others should thus continue to grow. “In the world where I grew up it was inconceivable an openly gay and married person could run for president,” says Mr Rauch of South Bend’s mayor. His odds remain long, but they are better than for any other openly gay politician in American history. And by running, Mr Buttigieg makes it easier for the next out politician to try.
