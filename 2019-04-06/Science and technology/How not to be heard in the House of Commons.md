BEING HEARD in Britain’s House of Commons is not always essential to get things done. One of the most influential and famous speeches was made there 230 years ago next month, when William Wilberforce denounced slavery and kick-started the abolitionist movement. Yet a new study suggests many MPs in the audience wouldn’t have been able to hear him properly. 
Catriona Cooper, a digital archaeologist at the University of York, used a computer model to recreate the acoustics of the 18th-century Commons, which was housed in the former St Stephen’s Chapel. Then, using reports of how many people were in the building at the time and where they would have sat or stood, she worked out how Wilberforce’s speech on May 12th 1789 would have sounded to those present. 
Many in the chamber would have been distracted by booming echoes, the model suggests. And those MPs in the best seats, including the front benches, would have heard worst of all. To them, Wilberforce’s fine rhetoric would have been a mush of rebounded sound. In fact, the best places to listen to this and other Georgian debates in the Commons were largely out of sight, in the doorway or behind the Speaker’s chair. 
Dr Cooper’s model, whose results are published in Parliamentary History, suggests that in 1798 the chamber had an average reverberation time—a measure of how slowly sound dissipates—of 1.6 seconds. A lower number means less echo, and the optimal reverb time for spoken words is less than a second. St Stephen’s Chapel sounded more like an opera house (which typically aims for a reverb time of 1.3 to 1.8 seconds). 
It burned down in 1834, but the acoustics of the modern House of Commons remain notoriously poor, and that’s not all down to the braying and heckles. High ceilings and stripped-down furnishings encourage echoes. Blame Winston Churchill for some of that. After the Commons was destroyed by German bombs in 1941, he ignored suggestions for a design that was more fit-for-purpose and insisted it be rebuilt faithful to its previous “intimate and conversational” style. The next chance to improve things will be in 2025, when the Palace of Westminster is scheduled for a long-overdue update. Whether that will improve British political affairs is open for debate.
