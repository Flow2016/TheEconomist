###### The war on penury
# India’s big, national parties vie for poor voters’ affections 
##### But will their anti-poverty schemes reach the right people?

“IT WILL BE days of joy,” says Rajmati, a health worker in Haryana state, when asked what an extra 6,000 rupees ($87) a month would mean to the poor households in her village. “It will also mean that you can survive without a husband.” Her enthusiasm is shared by the other villagers gathered in her back room, where she provides health checks, postnatal care and immunisations. One says she would use the cash to open a bangle shop. Another has more immediate aspirations: “more wheat, oil and sugar” for her seven children, and more money for their education. 
Six thousand rupees, with no strings attached, is what the Congress party is promising to hand out to the poorest fifth of households if it wins power in the national election that begins on April 11th. The party’s leader, Rahul Gandhi, has described the scheme, known by its Hindi acronym of NYAY (or justice), as a “surgical strike” on poverty. In reality, it is more like dropping barrelfuls of ordnance from 30,000 feet. It also escalates the “alms race” between the national parties, which are competing to show their generosity to the poor by offering health care, debt forgiveness and cash. After the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost three state elections in December, it rushed to alleviate rural disgruntlement, pledging to pay 6,000 rupees a year to farmers with less than two hectares (five acres) of land. By the end of March some 47m had received their first instalment, according to the government. 
Such ambitious efforts are imaginable for two reasons. First, India has become a (lower) middle-income country with a GDP that will soon cross $2,000 per person (and $10,000 per household). NYAY will cost no more than 1.2% of India’s rapidly growing output, says one of its architects—a slightly, but not wildly, optimistic estimate. Second, India’s payments system has greatly improved. More than 350m people, over half of them women, have benefited from the government’s effort to open no-frills bank accounts, and most people now have an official means of identification. All the women in Rajmati’s back room have an Aadhaar card (which gives them a unique identity number) and a bank account, although they complain about the cost of travelling to the nearest branch in a town over 5km away. Where possible, NYAY will be paid into bank accounts held by women, not their husbands. “If it goes to the men, they’ll take it away and never come home until they’ve drunk it all,” says Rajmati, raising an imaginary bottle to her lips. 
What has not greatly improved is the government’s ability to identify the poor. It already hands out ration cards to people deemed “below the poverty line”, entitling them to subsidised food and fuel. But many poor people lack these cards, and many cardholders are not poor. In rural districts the authorities typically decide eligibility based on the advice of village councils, the condition of people’s houses and a survey of household assets. 
The surveys can be horribly outdated. Haryana’s last was in 2007. They can also skew incentives. “People make their houses look bad, to get the BPL card, and then buy gold,” Rajmati complains. NYAY might contribute to this injustice (or anyay) by stripping benefits from people striving to escape the bottom fifth and rewarding people striving deceitfully to enter it. The workfare scheme Congress introduced in 2005 avoided this problem, since anyone willing to perform hard labour at low wages must be needy. 
Spotting the poor is, if anything, becoming harder. Martin Ravallion of Georgetown University points out that poverty in the countryside has fallen, moving closer to rates in the cities. The poorest are no longer confined to deprived rural districts, nor is everyone in such districts poor. In 2018 Rajmati’s district was identified as India’s most backward by a government think-tank. It can look that way, with many huts made of straw and squat bamboo storehouses, sealed with dung and stippled with pretty decorations. But new money is making inroads, visible in a resort hotel and country mansions covered in bougainvillaea. Outside Rajmati’s village, an Uber taxi struggles along an unpaved road through a wheat field, an envoy from the gig economy to the agrarian. 
These conspicuous signs of prosperity suggest an alternative approach to fighting poverty. Rather than struggling to include all the identifiably poor, why not exclude the identifiably rich? Arvind Subramanian, the former chief economic adviser to the current government, has proposed paying a near-universal basic income of roughly half the amount proposed by Congress (about 700 rupees per person, which would amount to over 3,000 rupees for the average household) to all but the richest quarter of Indians. Those to be left out could be identified by their ownership of a car, air-conditioner, large bank balance—or a mansion covered in bougainvillaea. 
Is NYAY, or something like it, any more likely to become a reality? Congress’s electoral prospects look slim. But NYAY’s sheer scale may force the BJP to offer something similar in response. Almost 60% of India’s poor, at last count, live in the six states that provide 69% of the BJP’s seats. Arun Jaitley, the finance minister, argues that the BJP’s existing schemes are more generous, taken together, than Congress’s proposal. NYAY, he says, is a “bluff” that people will not believe. But in rural Haryana, Rajmati and her clients enjoy entertaining the idea. Do they think an extra 6,000 rupees is too good to be true? It’s “too good to doubt”, says one.
