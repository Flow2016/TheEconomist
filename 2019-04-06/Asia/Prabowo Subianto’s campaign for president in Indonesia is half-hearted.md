# Prabowo Subianto’s campaign for president in Indonesia is half-hearted 
##### The former soldier may be running to secure his party’s future more than his own

THE CROWD at the University of the Republic of Indonesia in the city of Bandung surges towards the stage in anticipation. Then, to whoops and applause, Prabowo Subianto appears, sporting sunglasses and a traditional peci—a sort of small, black fez. After a prayer, the presidential candidate delivers a fiery speech, full of indignation. Indonesia, he says, lags behind neighbouring countries on all kinds of measures, from literacy rates to the performance of its national football team. He blames corruption and foreigners: “If we are weak, we are going to be stomped upon by other nations.” 
In the campaign for presidential and legislative elections on April 17th, Mr Prabowo is selling himself as the antidote to such weakness. The retired three-star general trades on his reputation for toughness, a stark contrast to his opponent, incumbent president Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, who nurtures a man-of-the-people persona. Mr Prabowo’s image is not just a branding exercise. He is accused of committing various human-rights abuses during his military career, including the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists. He was certainly a loyal defender of his father-in-law, Suharto, a strongman whose 30-year rule ended in 1998. That is a plus for many of his supporters, who yearn for a strong government. Naufal Ubaidillah, a student at the rally, says Indonesia suffers from an “inferiority complex” and Mr Prabowo would not be bullied by other countries. 
The strongman’s clownish side also appeals to voters. At the rally his wisecracking has the crowd guffawing. A campaign brochure released in December played up his lighthearted side. It responded to rumours that his penis was lost in a military accident (not true, apparently) and parried questions about his love of horses (“What is wrong with horses?” it exclaims). 
But Mr Prabowo’s routine has become rather tired. He ran for vice-president in 2009 and then for the top job in 2014. Both times voters turned him down. Has his offering changed enough to win them round? 
Mr Prabowo has toned himself down somewhat. His campaign in 2014 was full of props designed to remind voters of Sukarno, Indonesia’s founding father, such as white safari jackets and retro microphones, points out Stephen Sherlock of the University of New South Wales. All of that has gone. He rarely calls for a return to Sukarno’s constitution of 1945, which would be a step back for democracy. And he is more forthcoming about being part of the ruling class, although he still derides it. 
Mr Prabowo is also less energetic. He used to give speeches in three districts in a day, hopping between them in his helicopter. Today, the 67-year-old can only manage one, often looking worn out. Illness led him to cancel a speech in January. In 2014 televised debates were one of his strengths. Now he looks lacklustre in them. And he seems to have less money to spend, perhaps because his brother, who bankrolled previous runs, has been less generous. Mr Prabowo’s aides joke about running a “value-package campaign”. 
Mr Prabowo’s running mate, Sandiaga Uno, a businessman, has picked up the slack. His jam-packed schedule has made him the face of the campaign. He is also a big donor. Last year he raised roughly $40m by selling shares in his private-equity firm. He may be thinking of the long-run rewards. This campaign will put him in good stead to run for president in 2024. 
Jokowi has enjoyed a 20-percentage-point lead in the polls since well before he or Mr Prabowo officially entered the race, in August. Many observers wonder why Mr Prabowo, apparently short of both funds and energy, bothered to run at all. One explanation is that he expected to be campaigning under different circumstances. In August the currency, the rupiah, had fallen to levels not seen since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, owing to fears of a global trade war. Some analysts were predicting an imminent downturn, which would have tilted the odds in Mr Prabowo’s favour. 
Another reason to run is that a big, national campaign helps the parliamentary candidates of the Great Indonesia Movement Party, or Gerindra, the outfit Mr Prabowo founded in 2008. Mr Sandiaga is also a member of Gerindra. Choosing him as a running-mate, instead of a representative of one of the other parties backing the ticket, alienated Mr Prabowo’s allies. The decision has led some experts to speculate that Mr Prabowo is less interested in winning the election than in maximising Gerindra’s power in parliament. He could then use its clout to retain influence over the government, defend his and his family’s interests and perhaps secure a senior job. If that is the plan, it is working: the party is on course for its best parliamentary showing. Mr Prabowo may finally get a seat at the top table, just not the one he always wanted.
