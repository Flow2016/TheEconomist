# A draft bill would allow Hong Kong to hand suspects to China’s police 
##### Could it be used against the Communist Party’s enemies?

“TRUSTING CHINA is like trusting pigs can climb trees!” read one of the many sardonic placards held by protesters. Despite a chilly drizzle, thousands of Hong Kongers rallied at the headquarters of the territory’s government on March 31st. Many chanted slogans denouncing Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive. Pro-democracy activists delivered rousing speeches. A little farther out, a gaggle of masked demonstrators waved banners calling for Hong Kong’s independence. 
The demonstration was about a bill that, for the first time since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997, would allow the extradition of criminal suspects from the territory to China’s mainland. On April 3rd a draft was presented to Hong Kong’s legislature, which is all but certain to approve it. By China’s design, pro-establishment lawmakers have a majority. 
Under their “one country, two systems” arrangement, Hong Kong and the mainland are separate jurisdictions. The territory has concluded its own extradition deals with 20 other countries, including America, Britain, Canada and Germany. But Hong Kong’s law on the surrender of fugitives, which was passed shortly before the handover, in effect prohibited the handing over of suspects to the mainland by specifying that the legislation does not apply to “any part” (later amended to “any other part”) of China. The new bill would scrap this exclusion. Johannes Chan of the University of Hong Kong said the omission of China had helped to reassure countries signing extradition deals with Hong Kong that people would not be re-extradited to the mainland. Countries that have done so have been assured that the new bill will not be applied retrospectively. 
China believes that more than 300 fugitives from the mainland are lying low in Hong Kong, a former senior Chinese police official recently told the territory’s public broadcaster, RTHK. Most are suspected of economic crimes such as corruption. But some Hong Kongers worry that Hong Kong’s government, which often bows to the Communist Party’s demands, might use the bill to turn over dissidents and other political troublemakers at the central government’s request. Unlike Hong Kong, the mainland offers the right to a fair trial only in name. The bill does not cover political crimes. Hong Kong may refuse an extradition request if a suspect faces execution. But the party often pursues its enemies by accusing them of non-political offences. 
Anxieties about the bill have been fuelled by China’s apparent frustration with the use of Hong Kong as a safe haven by those it dislikes politically. In 2017 Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese billionaire with close links to powerful families in China, was snatched from Hong Kong by plainclothes agents and taken to the mainland. In 2015 five Hong Kong booksellers mysteriously vanished, only to resurface on the mainland in custody. One of them was abducted from Thailand, another from Hong Kong itself. Their offence was selling gossipy books about Chinese leaders. One of them, Lam Wing-kee, who was detained while crossing the mainland-Hong Kong border and released after months of interrogation, was at the forefront of the protest against the bill (he is pictured, wearing a baseball cap). Mr Lam says he plans to leave Hong Kong before the bill is enacted to avoid being ensnared by it. 
Perhaps to avoid focusing on potentially controversial extraditions to the mainland, Hong Kong’s government justifies the legal change in a roundabout way. In February last year a Hong Konger fled back to the territory after allegedly murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan. Officials in Taiwan want Hong Kong to hand him over. But Hong Kong says it is prevented from doing so by the law’s inapplicability to other parts of China. Hong Kong’s official stance is the same as China’s: that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic. Alvin Yeung, the leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, accepts that there is a strong case for extraditing the suspect to Taiwan. But he says there is no need for a legal revision as big as the one proposed; the law, he argues, should merely be tweaked to exclude extraditions to “mainland China.” That would still allow suspects to be sent to Taiwan. 
The proposed bill says that to be eligible for extradition, a suspect must be accused of committing at least one of 37 offences. They include murder, kidnapping and rape. A few relate to white-collar crime. Hong Kong’s government insists that adequate measures are in place to guard against politically motivated extraditions. Holden Chow, a pro-establishment legislator, says that even if the mainland were to try to secure the extradition of a political offender by accusing that person of a non-political crime, Hong Kong’s courts would be able to find the “disguised motive” and refuse the request. But Mr Chan, the academic, says the burden is on the defendant to prove political intent, which is hard. 
After lobbying by businessmen, the local government agreed on March 26th that the bill would not cover nine crimes that are commonly covered by Hong Kong’s extradition deals. These include tax violations and unlawful use of computers. The government also decided that extraditable offences should only involve those punishable by at least three years in prison instead of just one. That was a relief to some Hong Kongers who feared being handed over for trivial reasons. But many still worry that some extraditable offences are too sweeping, such as crimes “relating to bribery”. 
People in Hong Kong who worry about extraditions to a legal system so lacking in due process have company elsewhere. Only around 40 countries have ratified extradition treaties with China. Very few are rich democracies (France, Italy, Spain and South Korea are exceptions). China Daily, a mainland government mouthpiece, accused critics of the bill of “scaremongering” and said the law would “not be abused in any way”. In a territory where many people have misgivings about Chinese justice, it will be hard to instil confidence.
