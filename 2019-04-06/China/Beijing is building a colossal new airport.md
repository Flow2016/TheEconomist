OFFICIALS USE many superlatives to describe a massive new airport nearing completion in Daxing district on Beijing’s southern edge. It deserves them all. The golden-roofed terminal (pictured) is a triumph of design by Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British architect who died in 2016, a few days after work on the edifice began. At 180,000 square metres the building’s steel roof, they say, is the largest of any airport terminal. The ground floor has the world’s biggest seamless single slab of concrete. It covers nearly 250,000 square metres, roughly the area of 35 football pitches. The state-owned firm in charge of building the airport says construction has involved “unprecedented” difficulty. 
It was only just over a decade ago that the capital was boasting the completion of what it then called the world’s largest man-made structure—terminal three of the current main aviation hub, Beijing Capital international airport. That building (also designed by a British architect), along with a new runway, more than doubled the airport’s capacity to 80m passengers per year. Last year, however, Capital airport handled more than 100m travellers, making it the world’s second-busiest, after Atlanta in America. Beijing is “very ready for another new airport”, says a foreign airline executive. Daxing airport will have four runways, compared with three at Capital. 
In many other countries, a project on this scale would be beset with delays and cost overruns. But as always with big projects in China, NIMBY-ish concerns have been ignored. Officials had a free hand to requisition land for the airport: 13 villages were demolished and about 20,000 people relocated to make way for it. The construction manager, Li Jianhua, says Daxing airport is on budget (it is costing 80bn yuan, or nearly $12bn) and on time. It is due to open in September. Officials call it a gift for the communist country’s 70th birthday, which will be celebrated on October 1st. 
The airport is also intended as a gift for the relatively underdeveloped region south of the capital where it is located (67km from Capital airport in the north-east). It is roughly equidistant between the centre of Beijing and a new city, Xiongan, that is being built in Hebei province, south of Daxing, to relieve population pressure on the capital (Xiongan is a project cherished by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as is the airport). The cost of new infrastructure around Daxing, including road and high-speed rail links between the airport, Xiongan and downtown Beijing, is four times as much as the facility itself. 
China needs many more new airports. The International Air Transport Association predicts that by the mid-2020s China will surpass America as the world’s largest aviation market. By 2037 China will be serving 1.6bn air passengers yearly, 1bn more than in 2017, it reckons. But airlines also need more room in China’s sky. The People’s Liberation Army keeps rigid control of around 75% of Chinese airspace, a far greater share than most other countries reserve for defence purposes. It is reluctant to loosen its grip, say many in the industry. As a result, passengers often suffer long and unpredictable delays, especially in the corridor between Beijing and Shanghai, China’s busiest. If traffic grows as projected, the congestion will get worse.
