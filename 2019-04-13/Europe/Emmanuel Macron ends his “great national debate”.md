AT ONE town-hall meeting in southern France, discussion touched on the reintroduction of bears in the Pyrenees. At another, in Burgundy, Emmanuel Macron was questioned about poor provision for those with autism. The “great national debate”, which began in January and ended this week, has drawn attention to the marathon total of 92 hours that the French president has spent listening to such grievances and answering queries in public debates. Yet the consultation has reached far wider than these presidential shows. It constitutes an intriguing study in how to defuse social protest—and the limits of using such a tool to do so. 
Mr Macron launched his great debate in response to the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) movement. This began last November as a protest against an increase in the tax on motor fuel, but grew into a widespread and sometimes violent rebellion against his haughty style and top-down method of governing. Despite much initial scepticism and mockery, the results, presented this week, involved fully 1.9m contributions to an official online forum, 10,134 town-hall meetings, 16,337 “books of grievances” submitted by mayors, 27,374 emails and letters, and 21 citizens’ assemblies. 
All these comments have now been transcribed, digitised and analysed, partly by tech firms using AI, and the raw data have been made public. The results reveal some areas of national consensus, notably that curbing climate change is “urgent”, or that the French pay too much tax. There is a broad desire for more local decision-making and public services. And even the French agree that dealing with their bureaucracy is “complicated, incomprehensible, rigid and compartmentalised”. 
Yet, inevitably, opinion is split on many other matters. The same share of respondents argue, for instance, that France should be more welcoming to migrants as plead for tougher treatment of them. Participants propose plenty of green ideas, including better recycling procedures, or less meat-eating. Yet 58% say that they would not be prepared to pay, for example, a carbon tax in order to encourage greener behaviour. Such are the paradoxes of direct democracy. 
Perhaps the most contentious point concerns taxes and public spending. Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, acknowledged that the debate had revealed a ras-le-bol (fed-upness) over taxes. France has the highest overall tax take as a share of GDP in the EU. But Mr Philippe also insisted that the results showed the “maturity” of respondents, who know that “we can’t reduce taxes if we don’t reduce public spending.” This may be wishful thinking. The results suggest that 75% favour cuts to public spending, but this was a response to a question asking how, not whether, the budget deficit should be reduced. 
The great debate, in other words, was not a statistical national poll. Indeed part of the point, says Stanislas Guerini, head of Mr Macron’s party, La République en Marche, was “to put the voice of the gilets jaunes in perspective”. Online, for instance, only 10% of respondents called for the return of a wealth tax. Yet polls suggest that three-quarters of the French are in favour. Which is partly why opposition parties, and many gilets jaunes, have denounced the whole exercise. Christian Jacob, parliamentary leader of the centre-right Republicans, called it a “great masquerade”. 
Given the conflicting demands, Mr Macron now faces the perilous task of coming up with decisions that neither disappoint nor divide. He is expected to unveil his choices in the coming weeks. In some ways, though, the debate has already served part of its purpose. It has enabled the Jupiterian Mr Macron to show that he is willing to step out of his palace and listen to people. It has provided an alternative way to release national frustration. On the streets, the numbers taking part in weekend gilets jaunes marches have dropped from 280,000 in November to 22,000. The president’s ratings remain low, but have recovered to where they were last October, before the protests broke out.
