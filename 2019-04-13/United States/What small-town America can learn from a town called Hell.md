THE ROAD to Hell is paved with good tarmac. Water runs clear in its creek. The township in Michigan has only 72 residents, Hellians, but offers attractions aplenty. Post-office staff singe cards and stamp them, in blood-red ink, from Hell. Two bars—the Hell Hole and Hell Saloon—bustle with customers. Both of them, and a mini-golf course, are decorated with ghouls and monsters. Chuckling tourists browse a shopful of perdition-themed souvenirs. Most popular are T-shirts with slogans such as “Hell is my happy place”. 
John Colone owns Screams, an ice-cream stall, and much of the commercial centre. His red-roofed wedding chapel last year hosted 81 marriage ceremonies (including ten same-sex ones). He also threw three “living wakes” for sick customers who wanted to party in Hell before they died. Some 150 people a year pay $100 to be declared Hell’s mayor for a day. Tourist-money generates 18 local jobs. 
The township, founded in 1838, supposedly got its name from a visiting German who declared the local weather “hell”, or wonderfully bright. It thrived by hosting a sawmill and tavern, but like much of rural America its economic prospects slumped as farm jobs vanished. Hell’s only church burned down in 1963 and was never rebuilt, says Mr Colone. A lifelong resident, he frets that youngsters leave and “the only people moving in are senior citizens”. 
Hell, nonetheless, is a success. The Midwest’s landscape “is littered with has-been towns”, says Richard Longworth, who wrote a book about the decline of similar places. He notes other settlements dwindling much faster, such as Gravity, a farming town in southern Iowa. It once had more than 1,000 people but has steadily lost its pull, especially after the school and local businesses closed. It now has an estimated 150 residents, many of them elderly. 
Rural towns survive by adapting. Hellians are creative in luring tourists, preferring families who shop and eat with gusto, rather than the biker gangs that used to flock in. The township won national attention on June 6th 2006 by hosting a 12,000-strong party to mark 6/6/6. In especially cold weather, when Hell’s creek freezes over, television journalists are invited to report from its banks. Each autumn it hosts “Hearsefest”, a spooky parade. The result, says Mr Colone, is 70,000 visitors yearly. 
What could others learn from the boomlet in Hell? James and Deborah Fallows, who visited 42 towns and small cities across America, last year published a popular book celebrating the most successful. They say towns need “local patriots”, often in business, who are energetic, set out grand plans and excite others. They also need a clear civic story, “myth or a lie”, that residents can organise around. Being open—both to migrants and visitors—is important. It pays, too, not to be truly remote: being in the orbit of a city with a thriving university is best of all. Much of this applies to Hell, half an hour from Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. 
Some things, however, are unique to a town with an odd name. Mr Colone doubts that earlier generations would have been as keen on shopping in Hell, but says public attitudes have grown more relaxed. “Hell sells,” he says. Pay attention, residents of Satans Kingdom, Massachusetts.
