GETTING TO THE recent “Queer Culture Festival” in Incheon was a challenge. Upon emerging from the subway, participants had to pass through a large crowd of protesters who wept, prayed loudly and told passers-by that they would burn in hell. One man had painted his face and bare feet red and wheeled a large wooden cross up and down the street, wearing a red crown of thorns and a pained expression. Lines of police officers and a barrier separated the protesters from the square where gay-rights organisations, a local left-wing party and a handful of foreign embassies had put up their stalls. Later in the day a colourful parade of several hundred dancing people, vastly outnumbered by hecklers, made its way down the surrounding streets under heavy police protection. 
That was an improvement on last year, when protesters prevented the organisers from setting up their stalls in the first place and violently attacked the parade. Gay-rights activists in South Korea often have to contend with insults and threats of violence. The authorities do not seem to care much. The organisers of a queer festival in the southern city of Busan recently cancelled a street party following a dispute with the local government over permits. They said they would hold a protest instead. “We just don’t feel safe,” says Lee Jong-kwan, who helped organise the festival last year in Busan. “Rather than protecting us, the police harass us.” (The authorities deny any discrimination.) 
Unlike most Western countries, South Korea has never outlawed homosexuality. That is partly because discussing sex has traditionally been considered shameful. Many South Koreans used to be loth to acknowledge that homosexuality even existed, despite the occasional mention of gay affairs at the royal court in historical documents. That blinkered stance carries through to the present: a curriculum for sex education in schools which was introduced in 2015 makes no mention of it, on the ground that talking about it would only encourage it. 
Sex between male soldiers is illegal, and men continue to be sent to jail for it. Many mainstream politicians are vocal homophobes, which appeals to some Confucian traditionalists and evangelical Christians. (Of the 30% of South Koreans who identify as Christian, more than half are members of conservative Protestant congregations.) The leader of the main opposition party recently stressed that he was opposed to homosexuality and that South Korea needed to protect its “beautiful family values”. 
Most South Koreans oppose same-sex marriage, and the government has no plans to recognise it. Young people, however, are more liberal than their elders. More than half of those in their 20s think gay people should be allowed to wed, so no doubt they will be able to some day. 
For now, though, gay life in South Korea can be miserable. “Some of my friends have killed themselves, others have been forced into psychiatric wards or conversion therapy,” says Kim Hye-yeon, a 20-something from Busan. “There’s nowhere for us to go, nobody to protect us.” ■
