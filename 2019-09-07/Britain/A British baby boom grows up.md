# A British baby boom grows up

“THE OH, OH, Ohhh-lympics!” ran one tabloid headline. “As record 150,000 condoms are handed out to a host of super-attractive athletes, could London 2012 be the raunchiest games ever?” Official statistics regarding the sex lives of toned athletes are hard to find. But away from the Olympic village, another reproductive record was indeed broken that year. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), mothers in England and Wales gave birth to 729,674 children, the most in over four decades. They have struggled to keep up since (see chart). 
The boom followed a bust. Births began to slump during the 1990s, reaching a low of 594,634 in 2001. The subsequent growth reflected a number of factors (none actually related to the hosting of sports events). There was an echo of earlier baby booms, which increased the number of women of child-bearing age. This coincided with a rise in fertility rates, partly because of more births among older women, who had earlier postponed them. The average maternal age at birth is now 31, up from 28 two decades ago. 
And then there was an increase in immigration. A paper by the ONS estimates that foreign-born mothers accounted for two-thirds of the rise in births between 2001 and 2007. In 2000, 16% of children born in England and Wales had mothers who had been born abroad; by 2012, 26% did. An influx of youngish eastern European migrants after the expansion of the European Union in 2004 contributed to the boom. In 2010 Polish mothers overtook Pakistanis to become the largest group of foreign mums. Polish and Romanian mothers now account for more than 5% of births in Britain.

Changes in population always cause “stomach aches” for the welfare state, notes David Coleman of the University of Oxford. Predicting exactly when birth rates will pick up or slow down is difficult, because it depends on a range of factors from house prices to cultural expectations. But governments, both local and national, are forced to guess, since it takes years to build, say, a school. Another dilemma, notes Piers Elias, a consultant who advises councils on demography, is that local authorities must decide whether to prepare for the peak population, which is more expensive and may later result in empty buildings, or the average, which will lead to a squeeze during the busiest years. 
Maternity services were the first to be put under pressure—initially by the rise in the number of births, then by the increasing age of mothers, which results in more complications. The average class size in primary schools has since risen to 27.1, up from 26.4 in 2010. And a bumper crop of 11-year-olds is now heading into secondary schools, which tend to struggle with higher numbers more than primary schools because of the difficulty of attracting specialist teachers, particularly in subjects like maths and physics, says Jon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute (EPI), a think-tank. In a spending statement on September 4th the government confirmed that it would give schools another £4.6bn ($5.6bn) by 2022-23, a 10% increase. According to the EPI’s estimates, nearly £1bn of that will be sucked up by the extra pupils. 
Being part of a boom generation is something of a curse. Resources are spread more thinly and competition for them is more intense. This year secondary schools are likelier to be oversubscribed than in past years, because of the abundance of 11-year-olds. In contrast, universities are currently going to desperate lengths to attract students, owing to a shortage of 18-year-olds. By the time the Olympic generation come to apply, in a decade or so, it will probably be harder to get in. And things will not get any easier after that. When they head into the workplace they will face a truly Olympian task: supporting the even bigger generation of boomers who will be enjoying retirement. ■
