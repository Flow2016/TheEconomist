FOUR YEARS ago the unexpected victory of Mauricio Macri in Argentina’s presidential election marked the ebbing of the “pink tide”, a long period of hegemony of the left in South America. In its wake centre-right candidates went on to triumph in Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Colombia (although in Ecuador Lenín Moreno moved right only when in office). In Brazil last year a far-rightist, Jair Bolsonaro, won the presidency. Shortly after Mr Macri’s victory, in Venezuela the opposition trounced the United Socialist Party of Nicolás Maduro in a parliamentary election, the last free contest that country has seen. And Evo Morales, Bolivia’s leftist president since 2006, lost a referendum to change the constitution to allow him to run for a fourth term. 
Last month Mr Macri’s bid for a second term foundered when he fared badly in “primary” elections (in reality, a dress rehearsal). Everything suggests that in the real thing in October the Peronists will return to power in the form of Alberto Fernández, a social democrat, and his running-mate, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who ruled as a leftist populist from 2007 to 2015. Will Argentina once again portend a broader shift in the region’s political weather? 
Some analysts think so. Noting that leftists had lost in the recent past because they were incumbents rather than because voters had become more conservative, Christopher Garman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy, wrote that “anti-establishment, or change” elections risk ending market-friendly policies in several South American countries over the next three years. 
He has a point. Leftist presidents were popular in part because the pink tide coincided with a commodity boom. Their successors did not have their luck. Governing is hard in South America nowadays. Voters are angry about a mixture of slower growth or economic stagnation, corruption scandals, crime and poor public services (see article). The fake news, “alternative facts” and smears of social media have damaged the faith of citizens in their leaders and institutions. Political fragmentation means that several current presidents lack the legislative majority required to enact needed reforms. That applies in particular to Sebastián Piñera in Chile, Martín Vizcarra in Peru and Iván Duque in Colombia. In several cases, political honeymoons have been short. Mr Duque’s approval rating is in the mid-30s, while those of Mr Piñera, Mr Moreno and Mr Bolsonaro languish in the 20s. 
Yet none of this translates automatically into a return of the left. Argentina is a special case. The failure of Mr Macri’s attempt to clean up the economic mess left by Ms Fernández, and a consequent descent into recession and inflation, explain why voters have deserted him (see article). Perhaps the only potential parallel is with Ecuador, where Mr Moreno, like Mr Macri, has turned to the IMF and growth is mediocre. It is not hard to see a candidate backed by Rafael Correa, Ecuador’s former populist strongman, winning in 2021. 
But the left has its own problems. In Uruguay, after 14 years in power, the Broad Front looks tired. An election in October could bring victory for the centre-right. In Chile and Peru, the left is divided. Everywhere the Venezuelan catastrophe is a propaganda tool against left-wingers who have failed to keep their distance from Mr Maduro or to smash the icon of Hugo Chávez, his mentor and predecessor. And just like the swing to the right, the pink tide originally owed more to anti-incumbent feeling than to an ideological shift among voters. 
Populists tend to be more successful than moderates in riding out hard times. Take Mexico, which elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-wing populist, last year. He remains liked, mainly because carefully marketed social programmes and other gestures persuade many Mexicans that he is on their side. In Bolivia, having disregarded the referendum result, Mr Morales may win another term in October, partly because he controls the state. But eventually, if they are allowed to, voters turn against populists who fail. That applied to Ms Fernández and Mr Maduro. 
Rather than a shift back to the left, South American politics is moving into a pattern of volatility, with short cycles of change. That is a mixed blessing. It will make it harder for would-be imitators of Chávez and Mr Morales to establish lasting hegemony. But it impedes the long-term investment and continuity of good policy that South America needs.■
