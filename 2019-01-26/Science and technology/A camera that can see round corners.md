CAMERAS THAT look round corners already exist. But they rely on specialised lasers which blink on and off trillions of times a second, and light detectors sensitive enough to track individual photons. Something simpler and more robust would be desirable. And, as they describe in Nature, a team at Boston University in Massachusetts, led by Vivek Goyal, think they have the makings of one. 
In their prototype, Dr Goyal and his colleagues placed an opaque object called an occluder in front of a TV screen that was hidden around the corner from a digital camera (see diagram). Illuminated by the screen, the occluder cast a partial shadow, known as a penumbra, on a wall that the camera could see. Run through appropriate algorithms, patterns within the penumbra, invisible to the eye but recorded by the camera, could be used to reconstruct cartoon faces, university logos and arrangements of stripes that the screen had displayed.

The crucial part of the system was the occluder. Because its shadow was only partial, the wall reflected some light from the screen, but not all of it. In this case the old saying that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence is incorrect. If the size and shape of the occluder are known, it is possible, using sufficiently dizzying maths, to calculate from the pattern of the penumbra what light has been blocked—and thus what the image on the screen looked like. 
Having to know the size and shape of the occluder is, admittedly, quite a restriction on the implementation of Dr Goyal’s method. But these are early days. Future algorithms could include more unknowns about the occluder. That would slow things down computationally (and the prototype is not, in any case, that rapid; it takes 48 seconds to produce an image from the data). But, as computers get faster, this problem should eventually be surmounted. 
If it can be surmounted to the point where occluders of arbitrary shape, such as rocks, trees or parked vehicles, can be used, and the definition of a “wall” is similarly flexible, then round-the-corner imaging of the sort Dr Goyal describes might find wide application. Soldiers would love it, to help avoid nasty, hidden surprises. And self-driving cars that could see down side streets would be much safer. At that point a second old saw would have been proved wrong. Out of sight would no longer necessarily be out of mind.
