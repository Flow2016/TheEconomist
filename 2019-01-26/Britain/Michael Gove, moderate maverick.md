# Michael Gove, moderate maverick 
##### The evolving thinking of the most interesting Conservative

> Jan 24th 2019 
 
IN AUGUST 2016, when this writer took over the Bagehot column, Michael Gove was roadkill. Theresa May had sacked him from her first cabinet. He had broken with his two political patrons—with David Cameron because he supported Leave in the referendum, and with Boris Johnson because, while acting as Mr Johnson’s campaign manager for the Tory leadership, Mr Gove suddenly announced that his boss wasn’t up to the job, and stood himself instead. A publisher cancelled a biography it had commissioned. 
Today Mr Gove is cock of the walk: the most successful secretary of state for the environment in memory; a star turn at the despatch box; and a pivotal figure in the Brexit war that will determine the country’s future. In his earlier incarnations in politics, Mr Gove always played Jeeves to an Etonian Wooster. Now the Woosters have imploded and Mr Gove is his own man. As such he is the most interesting person in the Tory party. 
On January 16th Mr Gove gave a parliamentary masterclass in defending his government against Jeremy Corbyn’s motion of no confidence. With the government’s morale shattered by a defeat of 230 votes, Mr Gove preached the old religion of how a terrorist-supporting, Communist-loving beardie from Islington North couldn’t be put in charge of the country. The Tories whooped. On January 22nd he displayed a different set of skills in his testimony before a House of Lords committee on rural affairs, making light of the tension between raising productivity and preserving “the ties that bind”, and quoting Sir Roger Scruton, a philosopher, on the importance of beauty and Dieter Helm, an economist, on natural capital. He was careful to praise both environmentalists and his own Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: “If it’s not all power to the Soviets, it’s all power to DEFRA.” 
All power to DEFRA is not a phrase uttered by any of his predecessors. Most regarded the office as a way-station on the road to higher things, or a rest home before retirement. Under Mr Gove, DEFRA is the only government department that is doing anything interesting. He is masterminding four big bills that are designed to prepare the country for its future outside the EU’s common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy. He has conducted high-profile campaigns against plastics and wood-burning stoves. 
Yet Mr Gove is far from being a smooth politician in the manner of his old friends David Cameron and George Osborne. Beneath the accomplished surface is a man in turmoil. This is partly congenital, for Mr Gove is a bundle of contradictions. He is an outsider who craves to be an insider: he grew up in Aberdeen as the adopted son of a fishmonger but spent his time in Oxford hanging around with public-school Tories like Mr Johnson. He is a populist who loves high culture: during the referendum campaign he railed against the liberal elite, but later slipped off to watch Wagner in Bayreuth with Mr Osborne. He is a moderniser with a weakness for unpopular causes such as Ulster unionism (he was a vocal critic of the Good Friday Agreement) and a convinced Tory with a streak of wild radicalism about him. It was these twin tastes for unpopular causes and wild radicalism that turned him into a Brexiteer. 
Mr Gove did as much as anybody to visit the current nightmare on the country. He was the first of Mr Cameron’s inner circle to declare his support for Brexit, which deeply wounded the then prime minister. He did more than anyone to persuade Mr Johnson to jump aboard the Brexit bus. Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius behind Vote Leave’s victory, was a Gove protégé. At the same time, Mr Gove is worried by what he has wrought. He has broken with the hard-core Brexiteers such as Sir John Redwood and Owen Paterson who think, against all evidence, that Britain will be fine if it leaves the EU with no deal. On the other hand, he is unwilling to join his close friend Nick Boles in advocating membership of the European Economic Area. He is instead sticking with the prime minister’s middle-of-the-road deal, despite the fact that it was trashed in Parliament—and despite the fact that, as by far the most talented Brexiteer in the cabinet, he has it in his power to kill it off and force the prime minister to change her direction. 
Why has one of the architects of Brexit decided to stick with a policy that, by common consent, is an exercise in damage limitation? There are all sorts of theories circulating among his friends in the Westminster village, including that he regrets the whole project and thinks that the only thing left is, indeed, damage limitation. But three explanations are more plausible. First is that he is terrified of a no-deal Brexit. He has been inundated with briefing papers that spell out in detail what a break in supply chains would mean for food supplies and what the imposition of tariffs of over 40% would mean for the lamb industry. He thinks that the Conservatives could be out of power for a generation if a no-deal exit occurred on their watch. The second is that he is content to bide his time. He thinks that the most important thing to do is get Brexit over the line, preferably on March 29th, after which it can grow organically. Third is a political consideration. Having helped bring down Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson, Mr Gove doesn’t have a third assassination in him. 
A fourth possibility is that the radical at the heart of British politics may be belatedly learning the essential Conservative value of pragmatism. He recently compared Tories waiting for the perfect Brexit to “mid-50s swingers” waiting for Scarlett Johansson to turn up to one of their parties. It is an apt metaphor. The past few agonising months have not only shown that Ms Johansson is not going to show up. They have also demonstrated that Sir John Major, perhaps the most underrated politician in recent decades, had negotiated a cunning deal with the EU that kept Britain out of the euro but gave it access to all the benefits of the union. Brilliant Tory radicals like Mr Gove have their place—but only if they are kept under strict control by wise Tory pragmatists like Sir John.
