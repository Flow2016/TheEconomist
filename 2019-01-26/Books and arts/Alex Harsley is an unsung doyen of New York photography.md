AT THE 4TH Street Photo Gallery on the corner of the Bowery, silver-gelatin prints are strung together like clothes on a laundry line. There are portraits of Muhammad Ali and Jean-Michel Basquiat, plus a series of vintage cityscapes meticulously captured over 60 years by Alex Harsley, an unsung doyen of New York photography. 
The city has been Mr Harsley’s home since 1948, when, aged ten, he moved there from South Carolina. He took his first photograph ten years later, and became the first black photographer to work for the city’s district attorney’s office. His scintillating pictures freeze moments in New York’s evolution from the 1950s to the present. “It could start with the smell of something burning,” he says of his method. “And then you see a family sitting on the steps of a funeral home pensively looking at the firemen going through their routine.” 
Some of the scenes in the collection were captured from the window of his old apartment in Harlem; they include images of black activists, streets submerged in snow and shots of the Crown Heights riots of 1991. A.D. Coleman, a photography critic, says Mr Harsley has been able to capture the lives of minority groups by making himself “invisible”. His aim has been to assemble these fragments into an extended history of the city. 
Mr Harsley’s gallery is a time capsule. But, as it has been for decades, it is also a hub for the city’s artistic underworld. In the 1970s New York’s photography scene was flourishing, but exclusive. As Mr Harsley puts it, “a number of great artists were swept aside” because they lacked connections. Nurturing talent became part of his mission. In 1971 he established The Minority Photographers, an outfit that helps up-and-coming artists exhibit their work. He opened his gallery two years later; many photographers have had their first shows there. Mr Harsley curated work by Andres Serrano and David Hammons, among others. “It was kind of a school for me,” says Dawoud Bey, a photographer and one of the beneficiaries; “a one-room schoolhouse in the East Village.” 
“Sit down, start talking,” Mr Harsley would tell his visitors. In recent years, though, the neighbourhood around his gallery has changed as rents have risen. Some venerable retailers have been forced out. But Mr Harsley, who turned 80 last year, describes himself as a survivor. On warm mornings he still pedals his bicycle across the George Washington Bridge; the vintage sports car he parks in front of the gallery is a neighbourhood attraction. These days he works late as he digitises his archive, and keeps the doors open till midnight. “The Lower East Side keeps me in line,” he laughs.
