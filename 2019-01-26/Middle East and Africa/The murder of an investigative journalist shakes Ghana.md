AHMED HUSSEIN-SUALE DIVELA was stuck in traffic in Ghana’s capital, Accra, when two men on a motorbike shot him three times. The investigative journalist died before his friends could get him to hospital. His killing has shaken this vibrant democracy with its boisterous, muckraking media. 
Mr Divela had no shortage of enemies. He worked for Tiger Eye Private Investigations, a company that mixes award-winning undercover journalism with corporate sleuthing. Three years ago it exposed corruption in Ghana’s judiciary with hidden-camera footage showing judges taking bribes. A dozen were sacked from the high court. 
Last year it blew the whistle on graft at FIFA, football’s global governing body. A documentary showing match-fixing led to the dissolution of Ghana’s football association and the banning or suspension of more than 60 referees and officials. It was this probe that probably led to his death, says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who founded the company and is Ghana’s most celebrated journalist. Mr Anas, who keeps his identity secret by concealing his face with a veil of beads when appearing in public, has broken stories by disguising himself and pretending to be a janitor in a brothel, a taxi driver and a rock star. But after the football story came out members of his team started getting death threats. 
The most explicit of these menaces was made by Kennedy Agyapong, a ruling-party member of parliament who was implicated in the scandal. He threatened to reveal the identity of Mr Anas, saying he should be hanged. Then he appeared on television with a photo of Mr Divela and told his supporters where he lived in Accra. “I’m telling you, beat him...Whatever happens, I’ll pay.” 
Mr Agyapong has been questioned by police, but he denies any involvement in the murder. Opposition parties have called for him to be punished for inciting violence. Yet instead of condemning him, the ruling New Patriotic Party says that he should be given police protection. A spokesman for the party told a local radio station that Mr Agyapong could not be blamed for the killing since he had only called for Mr Divela’s beating, not his death. 
Mr Anas and Tiger Eye have started an investigation of their own into the murder. “We will not sleep,” says Mr Anas. “We will not surrender.”
