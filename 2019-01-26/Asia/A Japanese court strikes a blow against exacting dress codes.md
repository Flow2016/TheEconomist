JAPAN IS A country of conformity. As the saying goes, the nail that sticks up gets hammered down. For the most part, people obey rules without questioning their often flimsy or non-existent rationale. It was surprising, therefore, that two subway drivers in the city of Osaka refused to shave their beards to conform to the city’s “grooming standards”, despite receiving negative performance reviews and lower bonuses in punishment. It was even more surprising when, on January 16th, a court ordered the city to pay compensation to the pair for violating their “personal freedom”. Another court in Osaka is due to rule soon in a similar case brought by a female pupil against the city after her school obliged her to dye her naturally brown hair black to fit in with her classmates. 
Japan is rife with such rules about hair colour, style and facial hair. Schools and employers are the source of many of the silliest. Some go beyond appearance: many schools allow girls to wear only white underwear, as well as regulating the length of their skirts and the colour of their socks. Others are pointlessly hierarchical. A few companies reportedly ban new employees from using the lifts to begin with, making them climb the stairs to their offices instead. 
Over the years some bizarre but once common rules have disappeared, such as bans on drinking water during PE classes, which was thought to induce stomach pain. But others have become stricter. The Project to Eliminate “Black” School Rules, an NGO, found that students are more likely to encounter strict rules on hair length, eyebrow styling and the use of lip-balm and sunscreen today than they were ten years ago. 
It is no laughing matter. Annoying rules have been found to contribute to truancy, which is on the rise. Japan even has a word for suicide induced by onerous school rules—shidoshi. Pressure to shrug off pointless strictures is growing, as the court cases attest, but only slowly. For the moment, at least, rules still rule.
