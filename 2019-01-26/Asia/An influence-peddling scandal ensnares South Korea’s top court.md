FOR A MAN expressing remorse, Yang Seung-tae looked remarkably defiant. Standing outside South Korea’s Supreme Court on January 11th, the former chief justice said he felt sorry for “causing concern to people” regarding “events” during his term at the court, which ended in 2017. “I should take responsibility.” Even so, Mr Yang continued, nobody at the court had ever done anything “against the law” on his watch. Then he proceeded next door for questioning by prosecutors, to clear up all the things they had “misunderstood”. He failed: on January 24th he was arrested on some 40 charges stemming from his alleged abuse of his authority as a judge. 
Mr Yang’s indictment entangles the judiciary in the sprawling scandal that brought down Park Geun-hye, the previous president, and has implicated business tycoons, intelligence agencies and a grand university, among other pillars of the establishment. South Korean presidents wield huge authority with little oversight—a legacy of a long period of military dictatorship. Ms Park used her clout to get many supposedly upright and independent institutions to do her bidding. (She was impeached in 2017 and is serving a long prison sentence for corruption and abuse of power.) 
The prosecutors say that Mr Yang (pictured) neatly fitted this pattern, manipulating politically sensitive cases to suit Ms Park’s government. In return, they say he hoped for her backing for the creation of a new court of appeals to ease the workload of the Supreme Court. (Prosecutors say he hoped to take charge of the new court.) Mr Yang is also accused of forging documents, preventing the promotion of judges with left-wing views, passing confidential information to the president’s staff and misappropriating funds. 
The most prominent case Mr Yang is alleged to have interfered in concerns South Korean labourers’ claims for compensation for forced labour they performed at Japanese companies during the second world war. Mr Yang allegedly delayed proceedings so as not to jeopardise Ms Park’s efforts to improve diplomatic ties with Japan. The court ultimately ruled in favour of the plaintiffs after Mr Yang and Ms Park had both left office, causing the expected diplomatic ruckus. Mr Yang is also accused of trying, unsuccessfully, to move a trial related to the sinking of the Sewol ferry, in which 304 people died, to a different court. (The slow response of Ms Park’s government to the disaster sparked the protests that eventually led to her impeachment.) 
Documents which were made public last summer suggest that abuses were widespread. Investigators appointed by Kim Myeong-soo, Mr Yang’s successor, uncovered dozens of files with detailed instructions on how to consult with the government, rein in liberal judges and drag out certain cases. One document recommended Supreme Court judges consult the president’s office “unofficially and in advance” to preclude “unexpected” judgments in politically sensitive cases. Lim Jong-hun, another former Supreme Court justice, was arrested in October, accused of helping delay the forced-labour case, forging documents and manipulating other judgments. 
“The judiciary is one of the most privileged and exclusive institutions of the state,” says Kang Won-taek of Seoul National University. “It has changed little since democratisation; no government has ever attempted to reform the courts.” Park Jung-eun of People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a pressure group, goes further: “Officials feel they are above the people. Everything is done internally, without public scrutiny.” Senior judges belong to tight-knit networks that date back decades; many went to the same universities. Ms Park says this makes it difficult to uncover wrongdoing: “Whenever there are accusations, people stick together and the evidence disappears.” She expects more cases would come to light if the Supreme Court’s files were more closely scrutinised. 
Most South Koreans suspect that judges are too cosy with politicians and businessmen. They often complain that corrupt bosses get off too lightly. More than four-fifths believe the judiciary needs reform, and a majority say that serious crimes within institutions of the state should be investigated by an independent tribunal. 
Moon Jae-in, the president, has made the fight against corruption a central theme of his presidency, reiterating his support for judicial reform in his New Year’s speech. It is a hopeful sign that cases such as Mr Yang’s are now being investigated rather than swept under the carpet (the allegations against him were first aired while he was still in office, but not investigated until he had retired). Yet a constitutional amendment that aims to reduce abuses by curbing the power of the presidency failed to pass the National Assembly. Mr Moon invited Lee Jae-yong of Samsung, South Korea’s biggest conglomerate, to his official residence recently, though he is still serving a suspended sentence for paying bribes to Ms Park. It will take more than a few high-profile arrests to convince voters that things really are changing.
