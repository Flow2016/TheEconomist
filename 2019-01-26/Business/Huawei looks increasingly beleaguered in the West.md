ON PAPER, AT least, Huawei is having a barnstorming time. The company, which is owned by its employees, makes everything from smartphones to solar panels and telecommunications equipment. It reckons its revenue in 2018 will hit $109bn, up by 21% on the year before and almost three times higher than it was in 2013. It has recently overtaken Apple as the world’s second-biggest seller of smartphones. Engineers at telecoms firms say that its back-end kit, used to run computer and mobile-phone networks, is as good or better than the stuff provided by Ericsson and Nokia, from which it has gobbled market share. A wodge of juicy new business looms, as the telecoms industry plans to roll out speedy fifth-generation (5G) phone networks over the coming years. 
Yet the firm also looks beleaguered, at least in the West, where criticism is growing louder. America is seeking the extradition of Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou—daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei (pictured)—who was arrested in Canada on December 1st. America alleges that she used a Huawei subsidiary to dodge American sanctions on Iran. 
Another of the firm’s executives, Wang Weijing, was arrested on January 11th in Poland, along with a Polish citizen. The authorities accuse both of espionage. Huawei is already frozen out of the 5G market in America and Australia. Allies of America, such as Germany and New Zealand, have begun airing public doubts of their own. The University of Oxford has even said it will stop accepting money from the firm, which funds technological research in universities around the world. 
Western distrust is not yet universal. Huawei recently signed a 5G deal in Portugal with Altice, a Dutch telecoms firm, for example. Several British firms, including Vodafone and O2, are testing its 5G gear. 
America contends that Huawei’s kit exposes countries to Chinese spying or even to cyber-attacks that could bring down phone networks or other bits of important infrastructure. Huawei has repeatedly denied this. It fired Mr Wang after his arrest, and said his actions did not involve the company. It has pointed out that no evidence has ever been found that its products have been subverted. Mr Ren said on January 15th in a rare interview that, despite his prior service in the Chinese army and membership of the Communist Party, he would “definitely” refuse if China’s government demanded data from the firm. 
It is hard to see how any amount of public reassurance can help, since Huawei has got caught up in Western worries about China’s geopolitical clout. Nor are fears about espionage mere paranoia. A Chinese law passed in 2017 could force Mr Ren to comply with a spying request. 
Huawei has options. Its chairman, Liang Hua, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week that if the chill continues it might shift its geographic focus; previously Huawei had insisted it would fight to keep all important markets. There is still plenty of room for growth in India, where Huawei has already conducted 5G trials, and the rest of Asia, as well as Africa and South America. Its home market is enormous, and is predicted to dominate investment in 5G for the foreseeable future. 
But the biggest risk for Huawei goes beyond individual markets. It is heavily reliant on American and British chip designs, and also on Taiwan’s expertise in advanced chip-making. Some American politicians are pressing for legislation to ban American companies from selling to Huawei if it is found guilty of sanctions-busting, which would be crippling. Technological prowess is no defence against politics.
