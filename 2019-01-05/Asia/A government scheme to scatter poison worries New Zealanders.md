# A government scheme to scatter poison worries New Zealanders 
##### The target is invasive species, but the public debate has turned toxic too

IT IS AN unusual stance for animal-lovers, but conservationists in New Zealand are hoping to bring about a mass extermination—of non-native species. Though local fauna everywhere suffer from foreign invaders, animals in New Zealand are particularly vulnerable, since they evolved in the complete absence of mammals, bar a few species of bats. That made local birds and reptiles easy pickings for the rats that arrived on Maori canoes in the 13th century and, later, the stoats and possums that accompanied European settlers. 
It is these hungry four-legged immigrants, along with habitat loss, that are largely responsible for pushing 800 native species to the brink of extinction. In 2016, to save them, the Department of Conservation (DOC) launched “Predator Free 2050”, a plan to eradicate unwanted mammals. To succeed, the scheme will need a technological breakthrough: an infertility gene that rats inadvertently propagate, for example, or a lure so powerful that trap-shy stoats can’t resist poking their noses in. 
Until then, there is poison. DOC helicopters drop pellets laced with sodium fluoroacetate or “1080” into areas too tricky for trapping. It is an effective form of control, if not eradication, and bird numbers quickly rise in poison-strewn forests. The state owns roughly a third of the country’s land, and 1080 has been applied to almost a fifth of that area. 
But the toxin is controversial. In 2018 a group of anti-1080 protesters marched in Wellington, the capital, tossing dead birds onto the steps of parliament. In the wild, the resistance is even fiercer: wheel nuts loosened on DOC vehicles, staff threatened, poison found in an employee’s letterbox. Fonterra, New Zealand’s largest company, was forced to pull infant milk formula from supermarkets at an estimated cost of $NZ20m ($13m) after an anti-1080 protester sent it a sample of its formula mixed with 1080 and threatened to adulterate stock in shops in the same way. 
The objections to 1080 are various, and some stack up better than others. Protesters argue that poisoning animals en masse is inhumane. That is hard to dispute, but 1080 is no worse than other poisons. Critics are right, too, that the killing is indiscriminate. Other animals do sometimes consume the pellets, but that is rare, and the victims are usually not native species but larger mammals such as dogs and deer (something that incenses recreational hunters). Fears of residual contamination of the environment or water supply are unfounded, as 1080 biodegrades harmlessly. Then there is the conspiratorial fringe, who peddle outlandish theories on Facebook about the true purpose of the 1080 campaign, such as establishing a new world order or controlling the world’s food supply. 
In 2011 the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE), an official watchdog, conducted an exhaustive review of the evidence and endorsed 1080, noting that without such pest control, only one in 20 kiwi chicks survives to adulthood. Local scientists endorsed her conclusions. 
But 1080’s opponents have not given up. Fake facts do not help: a photo of 50 dead, apparently poisoned kiwis was circulated widely online, for example, although the kiwis had actually been killed by dogs. A lawyer arguing for an injunction against a pellet drop near Auckland told Radio New Zealand, a public broadcaster, that multiple people in America had died when a chemical related to 1080 was added to scrambled eggs. But that mix-up involved concentrated sodium fluoride, a tooth-strengthening compound added to municipal drinking water. Dangerous residue is scarcely detectable in the vicinity of 1080 drops, and in concentrations too low to cause harm. 
New Zealand First, a political party, campaigned for a ban on 1080 ahead of the most recent election, in 2017. It has kept quiet on the subject since becoming part of the governing coalition. But it may face pressure from its constituents to raise the matter with its main partner in government, the Labour Party. What would happen then is anyone’s guess. 1080 may have science on its side, but the debate about it has become toxic.
