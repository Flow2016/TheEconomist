STEADY IMPROVEMENTS in battery technology, driven along by the electrification of road transport, are helping air taxis and other small electric aircraft get airborne. But even the best lithium-ion cells are still far from being able to power the workhorses of civil aviation: short-haul airliners carrying 150 or so passengers. An electric version would not be able to rise from the ground, because of the weight of the batteries required to drive its engines. Nevertheless, many aerospace experts continue to think that electric flight is the future, at least in hybrid form. 
This could be achieved by starting with smaller hybrid airliners, such as those carrying 50 or so passengers on regional routes, and then scaling the technology up. Details of one such effort, called Project 804, illustrate how the airborne equivalent of a hybrid Toyota Prius might work. 
As the crow flies, 804 is the distance in miles (1,294km) between a Pratt & Whitney facility in Montreal, Quebec, and a Collins Aerospace centre in Rockford, Illinois. That the two firms are both parts of United Technologies Corp (UTC), which hopes to merge with Raytheon to form America’s second-biggest aerospace and defence company after Boeing, suggests that the idea is more than a flight of fantasy. Indeed, the experimental hybrid which Project 804 plans to fly in 2022 could slash fuel costs on regional routes. 
As with cars, there are different ways to build a hybrid plane. Collins, which makes aircraft electrical systems, and Pratt & Whitney, which produces jet engines, have chosen a “parallel” hybrid. That means it will use a combustion engine augmented by a battery-powered electric motor, as opposed to a “serial” hybrid in which propulsion is provided purely by an electric motor, but with the electricity for this motor either drawn from a battery or produced by a combustion engine running a generator, depending on the circumstances. Both sorts of hybrid limit use of the batteries, meaning the battery packs can be smaller and thus lighter. 
For its flight tests, Project 804 is converting a Bombardier Dash 8-100, a 40-seat aircraft powered by a pair of turboprops. These are jet turbines that turn a propeller at the front of the engine via a gearbox. 
Each turboprop produces two megawatts of power. Typically, the engines run at full power during the 20 minutes of take-off and climb, and are then throttled back for the cruise and descent. In the conversion, the jet turbine driving the propeller on one side of the aircraft will be replaced with a downsized version producing about 1MW. An electric motor attached to the turbine’s gearbox will provide another 1MW. 
The idea, explains Paul Eremenko, UTC’s chief technology officer, is that during a full-power take-off and climb the combination of electric motor and jet turbine would produce the necessary 2MW. Then, during cruise, the electric motor would be switched off. As the aircraft descends, which can also take around 20 minutes, the electric motor would run in reverse to act as a generator, turned by the windmilling propeller. This would top up the battery for a subsequent full-power take-off, or an emergency “go-around” in case the landing had to be aborted. 
Project 804’s flight trials will help work out both how such hybrid engines could replace turboprops on existing aircraft and how they might be used by entirely new models. As the downsized turbines would be optimised for cruising, they would themselves have better fuel economy. Working with the electric motor, the hybrid combination on a regional turboprop airliner, which typically flies routes of around one hour’s duration, would result in fuel savings of at least 30%, says Mr Eremenko. 
Other sorts of hybrid are in development. Earlier this month Ampaire, an electric-aircraft firm in Los Angeles, undertook the virgin flight of a six-seat Cessna Skymaster converted into a hybrid. Skymasters have a propeller engine at the front and another engine driving a “pusher” prop at the rear. Ampaire replaced the rear engine with a battery-powered electric motor. On its own, this engine would be a series hybrid, except that as it works in conjunction with the combustion engine at the front, Ampaire calls it a parallel hybrid. 
Zunum Aero, based near Seattle, is working on a 12-seat series hybrid which it hopes to deliver in 2022. This aircraft will be powered by two rear-mounted 500kW electric turbofans (which turn a fan inside a shroud and so look a bit like jet engines). The turbofans will be supplied with electricity by a small jet-powered generator in the rear of the fuselage, which will also top up batteries contained in the wings. 
For larger aircraft, electric turbofans that are vastly more powerful—perhaps up 20MW—will be needed. Much will depend on what Boeing and Airbus decide to do with their future models, and how radical their designs will be. An alternative to large engines is lots of small ones. Giant flying wings with many electric thrusters are one idea. But these would require a number of technological leaps, not just in batteries but also in aerodynamics and electricity distribution. 
More conventional-looking hybrid aircraft are possible. Airbus has teamed up with Rolls-Royce, a British jet-engine manufacturer, and Siemens, a German electricals giant, to electrify an example of a 100-seater regional aircraft called the BAe146. This plane is powered by four conventional jet turbofans, albeit small ones. To start with, one of the 146’s four engines will be replaced with a 2MW electric turbofan powered by a combination of battery and generator. If all goes well, a second engine will be replaced with a similar unit. Again, the idea is that a combination of combustion engines and electrical power will produce a cleaner, more efficient aircraft. Spurred on by environmental concerns and stricter controls on emissions, for larger passenger aircraft going hybrid seems to be the most likely flight plan.◼
