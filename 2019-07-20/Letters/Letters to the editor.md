I must take issue with “China’s chance” (June 22nd), which ascribed the recent turmoil in Hong Kong to China’s alleged suppression of Hong Kong’s freedoms and reluctance to grant the territory universal suffrage in electing its chief. China has gone much further than Britain in democratising Hong Kong. The promise of universal suffrage as the ultimate aim appears in the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, not in the Sino-British joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong. Nor did the British overlords take action to return power to the people until they learned that there would be no hope of extending British rule beyond 1997. 
It is naive to suggest that universal suffrage will solve all Hong Kong’s problems. Its people, especially the young, are deeply angered by the acute housing and land shortage, the widening wealth gap, worsening living conditions and the narrowing opportunities for upward mobility because of competition from a rising China. Hong Kong, however, is not unique in experiencing deep divisions because of growing disparities. 
Universal suffrage to elect the city’s leader, with groups fighting on opposing ideological or socioeconomic platforms, would serve only to amplify the existing schisms. Britain’s recent political polarisation among Remainers and Leavers is a cautionary tale for those who have romantic illusions about democracy. Our city’s priority must lie in tackling deep-rooted social and economic problems with a view to improving the livelihood of our people.

The intellectual origins of your analysis on the benefits of America’s and China’s growing financial ties (“Counter-flow”, July 6th) can be traced back to Montesquieu. In “The Spirit of the Laws” the French philosopher wrote that because “Two nations that trade with each other become reciprocally dependent…the natural effect of commerce is to lead to peace.” The underlying logic of self-interest still offers the greatest hope of an accord between these two countries.

Each week seems to bring an article in the newspapers on how the California Dream no longer exists and why the state is losing its businesses to other places (Special report on California and Texas, June 22nd). Let’s look at the facts. California is a $3trn economy, bigger than Texas and Florida combined. Regarding the “exodus” of people to states like Texas, California’s population grew by 18% over the past two decades, more than in any of the world’s rich economies. It has added 3.1m jobs since February 2010, and accounts for a quarter of all employment growth in America recently. The state is in good fiscal shape with a $21.5bn budget surplus, undermining the argument that it is not prepared for an economic downturn. 
Yes, California is not the cheapest place to do business, but it is prosperous, which owes much to its appeal as a destination for innovative companies. Some 17% of company properties in the state are research and development facilities, more than in China, Japan and Germany. 
It is difficult to agree with the assertion that California’s best days are behind it.

It is a mistake to say that in California “non-whites have outnumbered whites since 2000, and in Texas since 2005”. These often-cited figures assume that Hispanics are non-white. However, in the 2010 census, 53% of Hispanics identified themselves as white. Liberal states allow people to determine to which race they belong, in contrast to Nazi Germany and the Old South, which assigned race to people. 
Moreover, the implication that Hispanics are a race (“brown”) racialises a category of people that actually is made up of ethnic groups (Cuban-American, Mexican-American and so on). Ethnic divisions are more mutable and bridgeable than racial ones. Hence any implication that Hispanics are a race is best avoided.

In your report there was no mention of the rapidly growing Asian-American population in both states. Nor did you touch on the role of religion. California’s religious diversity makes it more receptive to science than religiously conservative Texas. Cultural pluralism is as important as tax policy in the two states’ effect on America.

The description of Texas as “freedom loving” and wishing to keep “out of people’s private lives” was too simplistic, given the state’s restrictive laws on abortion. In April this year a bill was proposed in the state legislature to extend the death penalty to women who have abortions. It did not pass, but this demonstrates that the love for freedom in Texas does not really extend to women.

Your analysis of whether London’s financial services can survive Brexit did not give sufficient weight to the cluster effect (“City under siege”, June 29th). The City is an extraordinary interconnected web of centres of excellence, a unique multidisciplinary cluster-of-clusters which has no rival. In our technological age, this connectivity is how businesses stay current and grow. In the markets that are likely to see the most growth over coming years (fintech, green finance and the yuan’s internationalisation), London has a significant lead over its competitors. Other expanding areas, such as Islamic finance, also benefit from the London cluster of legal, accounting and other professional expertise and London’s expert regulatory environment. These areas of innovation do not depend upon deals with the EU for future growth. Their scale is global, not regional. 
The City will continue to thrive, deal or no-deal.

If there were a referendum to vote out bankers in London I’d support it, but there isn’t. Luckily I was given a once-in-a-generation opportunity three years ago to change things so, along with 52% of the population, I took it. Will voting for Brexit change the way bankers behave, or the housing crisis, created by financial speculation? Who knows, but one thing is certain; voting for the status quo certainly won’t.

I know just the man to lead Wells Fargo (“The hottest seat in banking”, June 22nd). A Mr Herbert Anchovy (aka Michael Palin) was looking to leave his job as an accountant for a more exciting career as a lion tamer. His counsellor (John Cleese) suggested he make that transition by taking an intermediate role as a banker. I imagine that, after a few visits to Congress, lions will seem the more friendly to whoever becomes Wells Fargo’s new boss.
