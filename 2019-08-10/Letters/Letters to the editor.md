I can think of at least one reason why the increase in happiness in European countries coincides with the rise of populist parties (“The satisfaction paradox”, July 13th). The rise in happiness that has been recorded in national surveys does not necessarily affect elections, as only a subset of the population turns out. And populist parties are more successful at elections with a lower turnout. The parallel rise of happiness and populist parties is not puzzling if the satisfied tend to stay at home on election day.

Take Poland, for example. It has enjoyed economic growth, low unemployment and rising living standards, and seen the populist Law and Justice Party romp home at elections. Voter turnout hovers around 50%. Why don’t half these Poles go to the polls? Do they stay away because they are happy, or are they unsatisfied? Some might believe that their single vote does not matter. Some might think that none of the parties represents their views. Whatever the reason, there is a growing realisation that if only some of those who stay away could be persuaded to vote, the rise of right-wing populists could be forestalled.

Thomas Jefferson did not think of “the pursuit of happiness” in terms of our inward-looking contemporary scale of satisfaction. It is an elusive turn of phrase, but one closer to the classical philosophical notion of happiness as part of the individual’s civic existence. Through that lens, the pursuit, that is, the attainment or practice, of happiness reflects the virtuous life of the citizen within the body politic. This is the inverse of happiness as a quantity to be measured and exploited by politicians.

Your obituary of Li Peng (July 27th) described Zhao Ziyang, the general-secretary of the Communist Party at the time of the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, as a “seeming liberal”. Indeed, when he ran Sichuan province, Zhao allowed farm prices to fluctuate, causing production to increase. And in 1988 he invited Milton Friedman to be his only Western consultant after China experienced high inflation. Friedman said that Zhao was the best economist he had ever met in a socialist country.

Along with most other media, The Economist reminded its readers that three of the four congresswomen who were subjected to Donald Trump’s rants were born in America and the fourth is a naturalised citizen (Lexington, July 20th). It was commendable that you described his language as “racist” rather than “racially charged”. However, one point that is always overlooked is that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not “of recent migrant stock”. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States for many decades. Her mother did not emigrate to New York from Puerto Rico any more than I emigrated to New York from Iowa. We simply moved. 
It is unfortunate that Americans need to be reminded that Puerto Rico is a United States’ territory and that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.

One of the charges laid at the door of liberals is hypocrisy, the odious practice of preaching values and promoting solutions without accepting any of the consequences. For example, liberals (broadly speaking) are keen to allow asylum-seekers into their countries, but not into their own communities, where the only outsiders who are permanently welcome are those who can afford the house prices and private-school fees. 
My suggestion is that you bear some of the consequences of your values. Why not convert a small amount of space at each of your offices around the world into accommodation for asylum-seekers? Your good action would be widely publicised and set an example that might be replicated elsewhere. That is, if your desire to defeat Trumpian bigotry is genuine.

Plastic pollution that remains local to its source, either on land or in shallow waters, is certainly less of a problem than the vast amount accumulating in our global oceans (Schumpeter, July 27th). Some plastics are denser than water and do not float. The lighter plastics can incorporate heavier particles in their polymer resins to ensure they don’t float either. Plastic bottles, which otherwise float like boats on the water surface, can be shaped to flood easily and thus sink rapidly. 
It seems the packaging companies and their heedless customers are avoiding a simple and inexpensive fix to the worst part of the plastic pollution problem. Plastics and plastic bottles should all be made to sink to the ocean floor.

You compared Boris Johnson to Winston Churchill, because both leaders “inherited” a serious crisis (“Here we go”, July 27th). I disagree. Mr Johnson did not inherit, but actively helped create this Brexit crisis. He deserves no comparison to Churchill.

If Mr Johnson were to lose power in the coming months he may not, as you suggest, be Britain’s “shortest-serving prime minister”. Counting only those who formed fully effective ministries, he could still beat George Canning, who served as prime minister for 119 days in 1827. By a more generous definition, the record could belong to the Earl of Bath, who held office for 48 hours in 1746. 
Horace Walpole commented that the earl “never transacted one rash thing...and left as much money in the Treasury as he found in it”. Sadly, Mr Johnson is also unlikely to match these accomplishments. 
JACOB WILLIAMSLondon 
Mr Johnson’s closest parallel may be neither Churchill nor Neville Chamberlain but Galba, the Roman emperor who succeeded Nero in 68AD but lasted only a few months. The pithy and scathing assessment of Tacitus was “omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset”. Rough translation: had he never become emperor everyone would have agreed that he had the capacity to reign.

You mentioned China’s plan to land someone on the Moon by 2035 (“The next 50 years in space”, July 20th). This may be a repeat visit by China. According to legend one Wan Hu became the world’s first astronaut more than 4,000 years ago by tying 47 fireworks to his chair. The shear impact of his landing on the Moon caused the formation of a large crater, which is named after him.
