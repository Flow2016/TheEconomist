IN A LEAFY street close to a busy underground station in the southern city of Guangzhou, two middle-aged women sit in a booth giving out hand-drawn local maps to passers-by. These feature cartoon-style images of churches and other grand architectural relics of the city’s pre-Communist past. Nearby, giggling youngsters take pictures of each other outside one such edifice: a European-looking villa, its high garden wall topped with ornate green tiles. There are few foreign visitors. The hand-drawn maps are all in Chinese. It is young locals who are drawn to this neighbourhood of large three- or four-storey houses built in the 1920s and 1930s in Western and Chinese styles (one is pictured). Its tree-lined lanes dotted with cafés and art galleries have become fashionable hangouts. 
The area, known as Dongshan, is close to central Guangzhou, the capital of the southern province of Guangdong. It was built by the families of Cantonese who moved to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many old neighbourhoods in China have been bulldozed to make way for new development. Dongshan is an example of how some are being saved, and even turning chic. 
The survival of Dongshan’s old buildings owes much to growing public interest in preserving urban heritage—not merely the few structures that the government designates as important. Activists have been taking up the cause, and some developers have begun to support their efforts. 
Much of the credit for protecting Dongshan goes to an NGO founded by Yang Huahui, a primary-school teacher who grew up there. Fearing it would be demolished, he organised his students to make a website about the area’s history. This won a national prize and drew the attention of the local planning bureau. Now many of Dongshan’s buildings have plaques showing they are protected. Some display QR codes providing links to their history. Many original residents still live there. Official permission is needed for any renovation work. 
Mr Yang calls his organisation a “culture promotion association”. It is one of the few of its kind in China that has succeeded in registering as an NGO (the Communist Party is suspicious of activist groups). Its 60-odd volunteers visit old districts and gather oral histories. They also draw attention to buildings in danger of demolition. “We go there straight away, take photos, and tell the government departments there’s a problem,” says Mr Yang. 
Officials have long recognised the tourism potential of the colonial-style buildings on Guangzhou’s Shamian island and a nearby river front close to which foreigners first began trading in the 18th century. They are realising that other old districts—foreign-connected or not—have value, too. Xiguan, a residential area that was home to wealthy merchants before the foreigners arrived, now has several local-history museums. Many of its buildings have been listed as protected. Nearby, a stretch of distinctive colonnaded “shop houses”, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is being refurbished. It includes a network of alleyways, known as Yongqing Fang, which has been turned into a leisure zone. One popular attraction is a museum devoted to the late martial-arts actor Bruce Lee in a house where his family lived in the 1940s. It is a sign of growing interest in pre-Communist history. Last year China’s leader, Xi Jinping, toured the area. 
Some redevelopments cause problems for residents. Many people in Yongqing Fang were moved to make way for the new zone. Some buildings were demolished. The same happened in Shanghai’s Xintiandi district—a pioneer of such redevelopment. That area, which includes the site of the party’s first meeting in 1921, is now ultra-trendy. Shanghai has recently pledged to preserve 90% of its (few) surviving 1920s and 1930s residential lanes. While some areas have been revived, “demolition continues apace”, says Patrick Cranley of Historic Shanghai, a heritage group. 
Enthusiasm for old districts has been fuelled by television dramas set in the years before the Communists seized power in 1949. Young people like to take selfies in front of buildings redolent of that era. But Ying Zhou of the University of Hong Kong says local officials do not always recognise the importance of authenticity or retaining original features. “Often the bricks are new fakes, the history is concocted,” she says. ■
