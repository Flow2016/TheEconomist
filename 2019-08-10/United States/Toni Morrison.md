"OPPRESSIVE LANGUAGE does more than represent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge. Whether it is obscuring state language or the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is the proud but calcified language of the academy or the commodity-driven language of science; whether it is the malign language of law-without-ethics, or language designed for the estrangement of minorities, hiding its racist plunder in its literary cheek—it must be rejected, altered and exposed.” - Toni Morrison’s Nobel lecture, as the first African-American writer to receive the prize, in 1993. She died on August 5th.■
