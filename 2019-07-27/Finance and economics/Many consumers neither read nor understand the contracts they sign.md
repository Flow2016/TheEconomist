“TERMS AND conditions apply” vies for being the most morale-sapping four-word phrase of modern times, along with “The plane is delayed” and “You’re trending on Twitter”. Consumers read about a juicy offer, but fear a catch is hidden in the small print. The obvious solution—to read that small print—is not always feasible. Facebook’s online terms and conditions run to more than 3,200 words. Not too daunting? One section lists another 11 “other terms and policies that may apply to you”, including “community standards” on the content that users may post. A lot of further reading will be required. 
Even when users do read, they may not understand. Last year Which?, a British consumer-advice group, asked 24 volunteers to read the fine print on a selection of 40 insurance documents and answer a series of questions. They gave the wrong answers to between a quarter and a third; only four got top marks. Language analysis showed that the documents were harder to understand than the late Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time”. 
All this matters because “freedom of contract” is fundamental to the economic system. If two parties freely contract to make an exchange or enter a long-term relationship, both must perceive that it is to their advantage. But there is an asymmetry of information between an ordinary consumer and a corporation with lawyers paid handsomely to craft terms in its favour. 
Some economists have argued that consumers’ rights will be protected, even if only a few read the small print. By complaining about unfair terms, those few will keep sellers up to the mark. But one paper* found that only one or two of every 1,000 retail shoppers buying software read the licence agreement, and of those most examined only a small part of the text. This does not suggest there is a hard core of consumers who will keep companies in line. 
The issue clearly bothers the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a British regulator, which launched a campaign in April under the banner “Small Print, Big Difference” to encourage travel and tourism operators to treat customers fairly. 
As things stand, markets may be working less efficiently than they should. Consumers may fail to buy the best product on offer. This is easy to imagine with services such as mobile phones or energy, where there may be several points of comparison, such as a flat rental rate plus fees for usage. But another new paper** suggests it may be the case even with relatively simple products. The authors conducted a randomised trial with 124,000 British savers with savings accounts at five institutions. These are simple products and the main salient feature is the interest rate. 
Savers were given information about rival accounts that offered higher rates. On average switching would have taken around 15 minutes and made them £123 ($153) in the first year. But only around 3% were prepared to switch. The academics experimented with ways of displaying the information to make the benefits clearer. Enhanced disclosure made switching a bit more common, but not much. 
The most successful approach increased the share of customers switching to just 12%. Neither a saver’s age nor the balance in the account made a difference. The authors concluded that savers doubted the benefits of shopping around and were put off by the perceived inconvenience. “Caveat emptor”, it seems, may apply in principle but not in practice. ■
