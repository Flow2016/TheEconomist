CYRIL RAMAPHOSA is an avid cattle breeder. He once bought a herd of Ankole longhorns from Uganda’s leader, Yoweri Museveni. But South Africa’s president must feel that he has rarely dealt with so much bull as he has in recent weeks. 
On July 19th the public protector, an ombudsman, accused Mr Ramaphosa of violating the constitution by deliberately misleading parliament. This is a grave allegation. If true it would obliterate the president’s claim to have ushered in a “new dawn” following the kleptocratic rule of his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, in 2009-18. 
There is both less and more to the case than first appears. Less in that the public protector’s arguments are flimsy. More in that they can be seen as part of a broad assault by Mr Ramaphosa’s enemies. 
The case dates back to November. In parliament Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, brandished what he said was proof of a payment of 500,000 rand ($36,000) from the boss of Africa Global Operations (AGO, previously known as Bosasa), a company accused of graft, to Andile Ramaphosa, the president’s eldest son. Mr Maimane asked the president to “set the record straight”. 
The president could have gone away and checked the facts. But he did not. Mr Ramaphosa said that he knew about the matter: he had spoken to his son, who runs a consultancy, and who had insisted that the money was for legitimate work. If it proved otherwise, the president went on, he would take Andile to the police himself. 
Both Mr Maimane’s question and Mr Ramaphosa’s answer were based on a flawed premise. Andile had done work for AGO but this payment was to CR17, the president’s campaign to replace Mr Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). According to a sworn affidavit Mr Ramaphosa did not learn of the donation until an aide told him after he had left the chamber; the president had asked to be kept in the dark about donors, so as to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Mr Ramaphosa then wrote to parliament correcting what he sees as an honest mistake. 
South African campaign-finance laws are opaque. It reflects badly on the president that his team took money from AGO. And it would be naive to think that Andile’s surname did not help him get jobs. 
But the report from Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the public protector (pictured), contains no concrete evidence that the president “deliberately” misled parliament, as she claims. Indeed, Ms Mkhwebane paradoxically states that the president acted in “good faith”. Pierre de Vos, a law professor, calls the report “a legal and factual mess”. Mr Ramaphosa is seeking a judicial review. 
It is not the first display of the public protector’s incompetence. Courts have taken issue with Ms Mkhwebane since she assumed office in 2016. Most recently, on July 22nd, South Africa’s highest court found that she had lied under oath and acted in bad faith in a case involving the central bank. Ms Mkhwebane also has a record of (ineptly) going after Mr Ramaphosa’s allies while being soft on his enemies. 
The public protector is not the only source of woe for Mr Ramaphosa. Mr Zuma and his henchman, Ace Magashule, the ANC’s secretary-general, who is also accused of corruption, want to see the back of a president who is trying to clean up the government. Mr Zuma, in particular, may be hoping that having an ally as president might shield him from prosecution on charges relating to 783 counts of fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. 
South Africa’s GDP contracted by 3.2% in the first quarter of the year. The more the president is distracted by internal opponents, the less time he has to try to fix the country’s pressing problems. His record continues to be one of overpromising and underdelivering—which is, of course, exactly what his enemies want. ■
