WOUNDED AND under fire in 1998, Ramush Haradinaj grabbed the only thing that came to hand with which to staunch the bleeding. It was a piece of cheese. The previous year his brother was killed by Serbian soldiers a couple of hundred meters away from him as they smuggled arms together over the mountains from Albania. Since that war Mr Haradinaj has translated his consummate skill at staying alive physically to staying alive politically. His latest such manoeuvre came on July 19th, when Mr Haradinaj resigned as prime minister of Kosovo, saying he is now a suspect in a war-crimes case. 
Bouncer, carpenter, guerrilla and politician, Mr Haradinaj has had a more colourful career than most. In a memoir he talked of his experiences as a Kosovo Albanian guerrilla fighting Serbia with relish. In one incident, when trapped Serbian policemen were calling for help, he said he “took care of them in a precise way, from a close distance.” Mr Haradinaj has been dogged by accusations that he and his men committed war crimes, murdering Serbs and Albanians regarded as collaborators or rivals. He has always denied any wrongdoing. 
Mr Haradinaj’s resignation brings a sense of déjà-vu. In 2005 he resigned 100 days into his first term as prime minister after being indicted by the United Nations war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, where he was incarcerated during his trial. He was acquitted but the prosecution alleged witness intimidation, which he denied. The prosecutors appealed and he stood trial again, only to be acquitted once more. In 2017 he was arrested in France on a Serbian warrant and held there for almost four months. The French then released him; his arrest boosted his popularity at home. 
On July 24th Mr Haradinaj was questioned in a special Kosovo court, which was set up with international staff in The Hague after a report for the Council of Europe in 2010 accused several former Kosovar guerrillas of having committed war crimes. In the report Mr Haradinaj is mentioned only in a footnote but Hashim Thaci, Kosovo’s president, is prominent. 
The two have long been rivals. Over the past year Mr Thaci has discussed a potential deal with Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s president, which could involve giving up the Serb-inhabited northern part of Kosovo in exchange for an Albanian-inhabited part of south Serbia. Mr Haradinaj argues this would destabilise the whole region. Last November Serbia successfully prevented Kosovo, which it does not recognise, from joining Interpol for a third time. Mr Haradinaj took revenge by imposing a 100% tariff on Serbian imports, and Serbia suspended talks. With Serbian elections due next year they are unlikely to restart until after. 
Just because he has been called to answer questions in The Hague does not necessarily mean Mr Haradinaj will be indicted, says Jeta Xharra, a leading Kosovar journalist. Many speculate that the prosecutors are calling up lots of former senior guerrillas, hoping to break one. But, says Ms Xharra, given the UN tribunal tried Mr Haradinaj twice and failed to convict him, it is unlikely that this court will succeed. 
For now Mr Haradinaj stays as acting prime minister. It is doubtful a new government can be cobbled together, so elections will probably take place in the autumn. Mr Haradinaj is a past master at snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Despite his promises Kosovars still cannot travel to the Schengen zone without visas (although Kosovo has fulfilled European demands). He has doubled his salary even as the country remains isolated and poor. But with his decision to go to The Hague he has turned the electoral spotlight back to the war. Ardian Gjini, a close ally, says that, not for the first time, a challenge has given him “political wings”. ■
