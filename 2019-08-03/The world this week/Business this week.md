The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis, by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 2% and 2.25%. After nearly four years of tightening, Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said the Fed was loosening monetary policy amid uncertainties about trade and the world economy as well as lower inflation expectations. A few days before the Fed’s meeting, figures showed that the American economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the second quarter, well below the first quarter’s 3.1%. See article. 
The euro zone’s economy grew at an annualised rate of just 0.8% in the second quarter. Inflation, meanwhile, fell again in July, to 1.1%, short of the European Central Bank’s 2% target. At a meeting of the ECB on July 25th, Mario Draghi, its outgoing president, signalled that he was “determined to act” to address the euro zone’s persistently low inflation. Many investors are expecting a new round of interest-rate cuts in September. See article. 
The London Stock Exchange reached an agreement to buy Refinitiv, a provider of financial data, for $27bn. Refinitiv is jointly owned by Blackstone and Thomson Reuters, who will both obtain a stake in the LSE as part of the deal. By acquiring Refinitiv, the stock exchange and clearing-house group will greatly expand its market-information operations, pitting it on many trading floors against Bloomberg, another data provider. See article. 
In a deal that creates a behemoth in the market for everyday drugs, Pfizer agreed to merge its off-patent medicines business with Mylan, a generics drugmaker. The transaction will place Pfizer’s previously bestselling drugs such as Viagra, which came up against stiff competition from generic versions when its patent expired, in a new company alongside Mylan’s products. 
Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair, Europe’s biggest low-cost airline, said that around 900 jobs might be shed, including 500 pilots, in part because the grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft has caused Ryanair to cut flights. See article. 
In Washington the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved sanctions on firms involved with Nord Stream 2, Russia’s gas pipeline to Germany (Congress must approve the bill). Observers think the pipeline is an attempt by Vladimir Putin to increase European reliance on Russian energy. 
America’s Justice Department approved the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, but only after the mobile-telecoms companies agreed to sell a range of assets to Dish, a satellite-TV company, that will bolster its wireless services and expand competition in the market. T-Mobile and Sprint still face a lawsuit trying to block the deal brought by several states, led by California and New York, before they can seal their transaction. 
Huawei, a Chinese telecoms-equipment maker, reported a 23% increase in revenue in the first half of the year and said its 5G business was thriving, despite being blacklisted by America. The company did acknowledge, however, that America’s prohibition on its hardware was affecting smartphone sales outside China. 
SoftBank announced the creation of a second Vision Fund through which it and outside investors will back technology startups. The new fund hopes to raise $108bn. See article. 
After 20 years of legal to and fro, the European Court of Justice ruled that a two-second sample from Kraftwerk’s “Metall auf Metall” that was used in another song represented a reproduction of the original work and required a licence. The decision could have a profound effect on the music industry, especially hip-hop. The court also decided, however, that a music sample that had been “modified” did not amount to a reproduction. See article. 
InterContinental Hotels, which counts the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands among its assets, became the first global hotel business to stop supplying miniature toiletries in its rooms in order to cut down on plastic. It will instead provide shampoo and the like in larger receptacles across its more than 5,600 properties. See article. 
Procter & Gamble recorded a big net quarterly loss after writing down the value of its Gillette shaving products business by $8bn. This was in part because of a “lower shaving frequency” in developed markets, as the fashion for beards (see picture) grows ever more popular among younger men. 
The rivalry in the food-delivery market heated up with Takeaway.com’s $10bn proposed takeover of Just Eat. Takeaway operates mostly in Germany and eastern Europe, and Just Eat in Britain and western Europe; a merger would make them more competitive against Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Food-delivery drivers are also taking a bigger bite of the market; a survey this week found that more than a quarter of them in America had nibbled on customers’ orders.
