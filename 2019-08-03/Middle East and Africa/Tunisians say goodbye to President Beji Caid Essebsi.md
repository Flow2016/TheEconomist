THERE ARE rarely heartfelt funerals for Arab presidents. Those who pass away while in office are laid to rest in stage-managed events, more spectacle than remembrance. Others live long enough to fall out of power, and out of favour with their successors. Muhammad Morsi, Egypt’s sole democratic leader, ousted by the current president, was unceremoniously dumped into a grave in the early morning after his sudden death in June. 
The greatest tribute to Beji Caid Essebsi is that he was an exception. The president of Tunisia, the only country to emerge from the Arab spring as a democracy, died on July 25th. Mr Essebsi, who was 92, steered Tunisia’s nascent democracy through a rough patch. He also failed to fix many of its problems. But he left behind a country that held an orderly transfer of power and will elect a new democratic leader in September. For that, even his detractors were grateful. The expressions of sorrow after his death were genuine. 
An old man, a mandarin of the ancien régime, Mr Essebsi was an odd fit for the presidency of a young and newly free country. After studying law in Paris he returned home to a long string of official posts under the dictators who ruled Tunisia for half a century: ambassador to France and Germany, foreign minister, speaker of parliament. The revolution of 2011 brought a brief stint as interim prime minister. That might have been the end of his career. 
History went a different way. The first elected government after the revolt was led by Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party. In 2013, after two political assassinations sparked mass protests, it agreed to step down. Mr Essebsi returned to the scene as the head of Nidaa Tounes, a coalition of secular forces determined to unseat Ennahda. He won a presidential election in 2014 with 56% of the vote and his party gained a plurality in parliament. 
Some Tunisians compared Mr Essebsi to Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the general who led the coup against Mr Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood. Before the election they joked that the only difference between the men was “a dot”, a reference to the similarity of their names in Arabic. The comparison was unfair. Though Mr Essebsi wanted a stronger presidency, he did not try to dismantle Tunisia’s democracy. Unlike Mr Sisi, who crushed the Brotherhood, Mr Essebsi struck up a friendship with Ennahda’s leader, Rachid Ghannouchi. Until last year Nidaa Tounes governed in concert with Ennahda. A few of Mr Essebsi’s pet projects were laudable, notably an effort to grant women equal rights under inheritance laws, which was approved last year. 
The economy was a constant struggle, though. An IMF-backed austerity programme outraged the public. As Mr Essebsi’s support waned, his party splintered: about half of his MPs are now aligned with other groups. Over the past year he fell out with the prime minister, Youssef Chahed, who will lead his own secular faction in parliamentary elections in October. 
The speaker of parliament, Muhammad Ennaceur, has taken over as interim president. A transition had been imminent anyway: Mr Essebsi did not plan to seek a second term, saying a younger person should hold the job. His death simply speeds up what looks to be an uncertain vote. Polls show established parties doing poorly. In June lawmakers approved amendments to the electoral law that block several popular would-be candidates, such as Nabil Karoui, a media magnate whose television channel is often critical of the government. Mr Karoui was subsequently charged with money-laundering, which would seem to scupper his chances. 
Since the uprising, Tunisia’s politics have often been reduced to a struggle between Islamists and secularists, or between entrenched labour unions and powerful businessmen linked to the old regime. The public is growing tired of these factions. Established parties are in chaos and voters are hungry for political outsiders. The next president, whoever it is, will be judged above all on his or her handling of a sluggish economy. Mr Essebsi was right: Tunisia needs a younger leader—one not caught up in the battles of the past. ■
