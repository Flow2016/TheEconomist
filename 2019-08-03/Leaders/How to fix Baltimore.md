DONALD TRUMP likes to grab the news with a barrage of tweets. Just weeks after insulting four Democratic congresswomen, all from minority backgrounds, the president has found another target. On July 27th it was Elijah Cummings, a black Democratic congressman from Maryland’s seventh district, home to much of the city of Baltimore, who attracted the president’s wrath. Mr Cummings, who as chairman of the House Oversight Committee has been investigating Mr Trump, comes from “the worst run and most dangerous” district in America, the president jeered. Much of the city, he said, is a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess”, in which “no human being would want to live”. 
Mr Trump’s invective smacks of bigotry: congressmen from poor white districts do not receive insults in the same vein. And Baltimoreans are naturally seething at the contempt that their president seems to have for them. 
Yet while the president is hitting out at his foes and cranking up the politics of outrage, Baltimore’s problems are all too real. It is one of America’s great cities: Johns Hopkins University, the Victorian splendour of Fell’s Point, and an important port are assets most American mayors would dream of. But it is also deeply troubled. Since the spring of 2015, when Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died in police custody, sparking rioting that set parts of the city alight, Baltimore has struggled to hold itself together (see article). 
In 2019 the number of murders is likely to surpass 300 for the fifth year in a row, in a city of 602,000 people. Baltimore has more homicides than New York, which has 14 times more people. Last year heroin and fentanyl killed nearly three times as many people as murderers did; the overdose rate is the worst of any big American city. No wonder the population fell last year, by 1.2%. 
The causes of these problems are long-term and structural. Deindustrialisation, baleful planning and white flight all hit hard from the 1960s onwards. But the recent deterioration was not inevitable, even after the riot. And though Mr Cummings does not deserve Mr Trump’s barbs, the Democratic Party to which he belongs, and which has controlled the city of Baltimore since 1967, must take its share of responsibility. It has long struggled to get a grip on the city’s problems. In May the city’s mayor, Catherine Pugh, resigned after being investigated over a corruption scandal involving the purchase of thousands of copies of a children’s book she had written. She is the second mayor to have resigned over graft allegations in a decade. Baltimore has had five police commissioners in as many years. 
The city has many problems, from its dilapidated schools to urban deprivation and decrepit infrastructure. The most urgent, though, is the violence: people will not stay where they do not feel safe. And that is the result of appalling policing. 
Some on the left talk about cops as though they were an occupying force who need to be defeated. In fact Baltimore is far from overpoliced. Since 2002 the number of police officers has been cut by a quarter. Just over 2,500 cops cannot hope to solve over 300 murders a year. More money is needed. It should probably come from the state of Maryland, which is run by Larry Hogan, a Republican, and a Democratic legislature. Suburban voters may bristle at giving money to their poorly run neighbour, but they cannot pretend that they owe nothing to the city. 
The quid pro quo for this funding must be reform. On the right, people such as Mr Trump act as though police can stop crime only if they are allowed to rough up suspects. That is why his government has stopped issuing consent decrees (an Obama-era policy where the federal government monitors police departments accused of brutality; Baltimore has had one since 2017). But thuggery makes police departments less effective. When people do not trust cops, they will not volunteer information about crimes. And until victims are confident of justice, they will resort instead to revenge. 
Baltimore has repeatedly failed to clean up its police. It has had cops clearing street corners rather than investigating murders. Corruption and brutality have gone unpunished. Projects such as Operation Ceasefire, which stopped tit-for-tat killings in other cities, have been tried only half-heartedly. 
Unless Baltimore can get crime under control, it will continue to lose businesses and better-heeled residents and the taxes they pay. The risk is that one of America’s great metropolises enters a death spiral, as Detroit had by the 1990s. If that happens, Mr Trump’s tweets will be the least of its problems. ■
