Your article on innovation in insurance (“Run for cover”, July 20th) did not touch on a fundamental transformation that is taking place across the life-, health- and motor-insurance markets, namely incentivising customers to be healthier and to make better choices. This acknowledges that the nature and treatment of risk has shifted, from pre-existing risk to risk driven by behavioural factors. Some 60% of mortality and 80% of the global disease burden are a function of just four lifestyle choices—lack of exercise, poor nutrition, smoking and alcohol abuse—which lead to major non-communicable diseases. 
This new approach to risk allows companies to share the gains resulting from healthier choices with their customers, by funding valuable incentives and lowering premiums, creating a shared-value loop. It has also created a more profound role for insurers: not only providing protection against adverse events, but helping make society healthier.

Insurance companies are indeed clueless about the most recent advances in climate and weather modelling, even though the risks they cover are “becoming more severe and unpredictable.” But because insurers usually offer short-term contracts this problem is of only minor importance to their business at this point. It does pose more complex challenges for governments, property owners and lenders, who are in it for the long-term. 
You also lauded the innovation of “parametric insurance”, where polices pay out when clearly defined parameters, such as rainfall threshold, are reached. But the evidence suggests that when insurers tried to sell these parametric products (initially for crops in low-income countries), the take-up was very low, even when premiums were subsidised. Still too often, parametric insurance is akin to a lottery ticket, as basis risk—the lack of correspondence between the parametric trigger and experienced damage—is high. Risk modelling needs to improve before many of these products should be sold.

Alan Turing did not build Colossus, an electronic digital computer that made a big contribution to breaking the German Lorenz cipher in the second world war (“Due credit”, July 20th). That acclaim should go to Tommy Flowers. He got no public recognition at the time and has had precious little since. Flowers was born to a working-class family in Poplar, a poor part of east London. He was educated through an apprenticeship and by taking night classes at the University of London. He deserves to be remembered for his achievement.

“Blow up” (July 6th) reported on Colombia’s expanded coca cultivation and the government’s poor options for dealing with it. This illustrates only too clearly the curse that the UN drug conventions and their enforcement by America in its war on drugs have cast upon the country. There is a case that Colombia’s guerrilla movements would have made peace in the early 1990s had it not been for the cocaine revenues that gave the FARC ample means to carry on. Now, ironically, a surge in coca cultivation, that is in part a perverse result of that peace process, is fuelling a recrudescence of violence in the coca-growing areas that the FARC abandoned. 
Other countries should give Colombia time to reduce production and support its efforts in tracing assets and disrupting flows of cash, cocaine and precursor chemicals, which can be just as effective as crop eradication. In Bogotá there are concerns that American impatience might lead the administration to decertify Colombia for its slow progress. This was tried in the mid-1990s. It succeeded in getting Colombia to reintroduce extradition but also contributed to a dramatic increase in coca cultivation and paramilitary violence. There could not be a worse time for a repetition of that, with the peace process at such a delicate stage. And Colombia is America’s key ally in dealing with the Venezuelan crisis.

Scenarios should radically challenge conventional thinking, rather than just sound crazy, as the leader accompanying The World If suggests (“Navigating the rapids”, July 6th). At the Oxford Scenarios Programme, we argue that the value of scenarios lies in the actions taken as a consequence of thinking through a small set of alternative possible futures, which cannot be dismissed as crazy, and instead have sufficient connection with reality to pose credible challenges to current thinking. What may appear crazy to one member of a team is reasonable to another. What matters is making sense of the apparent strangeness or incompatibility of contrasting and different perspectives to help leaders navigate turbulence. 
Good scenarios are thus honed for a specific user, use, and purpose. Rigorous theory and method guide the use of these scenarios and help executives go beyond responding to things haphazardly.

Thanks for the annual summer brain exercises in The World If. Reading about future forecasting reminds me of Isaac Asimov’s early novel, “Foundation”, in which a mathematician discovers the future. A lesson can be derived from this book: the mathematician refuses to share his findings because by doing so it would modify, and potentially annihilate, his predictions. 
In other words, by sharing a handful of speculative scenarios, you may have changed the course of history.

The future is not always conveniently packaged. Around 1990 Bell Laboratories conducted a survey among its most insightful prognosticators regarding the most significant communications technologies that would lead us into the millennium. ISDN made the list; the internet did not. As Yogi Berra (may have) said, it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.

The parents of the students who refused to take Trump supporters as roommates should be asking for their tuition back (“Strange bedfellows”, July 20th). The core skill of an educated person is to be able to listen to an opposing view, engage with it, find common ground if possible, learn from it and respect it. By rejecting Trump supporters, these students mimic his behaviour by gleefully rejecting anyone who disagrees with them. 
My second thought after reading the article, is where can I find an apartment for $625 a month?
