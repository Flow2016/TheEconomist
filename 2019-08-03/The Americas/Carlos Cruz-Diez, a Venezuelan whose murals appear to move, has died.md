ON THEIR WAY into or out of the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Caracas passengers often pause to photograph themselves and each other before murals so vivid they seem to breathe. They are the work of Carlos Cruz-Diez, a Venezuelan artist who died on July 27th. Mr Cruz-Diez, who spent most of his career in Paris, helped invent “kinetic art”, which appears to move. His work gives Venezuelans, who are enduring dictatorship and economic collapse, something to celebrate.■
