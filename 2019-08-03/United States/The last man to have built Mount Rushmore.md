IT WAS THE dust that he hated most. Clouds in the high, thin, South Dakotan air, that choked him as he dangled in a harness on the mountainside. The men wielded jackhammers, drilling holes so sticks of dynamite could be pressed into the rock. Then, as they retreated on a president’s head—for a lunch of meatloaf sandwiches, if lucky—fuses fizzed and granite blasted off below. Few bothered with masks, except when the boss, Gutzon Borglum, came on site. One man snipped a hole in his to let him smoke as he drilled. In any case the damned particles got “into your eyes, ears, hair, nose and worst of all your throat.” 
From 1938 to 1940 Nick Clifford was on Mount Rushmore, first as dogsbody and wood-chopper, then as labourer and winchman. Signed up before he was a man, he suspected they sought out his baseball skills. The chief’s son loved the game and his weekend team needed a pitcher. In the week he enjoyed winching best. For that you perched on one or other president’s skull, taking in a grand view of the Black Hills, and moved others’ harnesses into place. Hourly pay was good for the tail end of the Depression: 50 cents, rising to a heady $1.25 for a skilled sculptor. Work stopped in winter. No one got overtime. 
Some 400 men were on site at some point or other from 1927 to 1941. They blasted 450,000 tons of granite, so the sculptors could reveal the four presidents within. Remarkably no one was killed, despite explosions twice daily, dropped tools, accidents with winches and one terrifying time when the “bucket”—a contraption that hoisted men and gear to the mountain top—hurtled, unrestrained, back to earth. A few died fairly soon afterwards. The wife of one worker suspected silicosis, perhaps worsened by heavy smoking habits. 
Mr Clifford didn’t light up. At 98, the last surviving worker remains relatively hale and won’t retire. Three days each week he attends to visitors at the monument’s gift shop. Always in blue denim shirt and pale baseball cap, he poses for photographs, although Carolyn, his wife, confides he hates cameras. “I couldn’t be better,” he says, but he declines even handshakes from children or much conversation. The inquisitive are told all their questions have already been answered in his book, on sale for $12. It includes a baseball card. 
Most wonder about prosaic matters. Was it hard toil? (Yes.) Was he scared, swaying in the wind by Lincoln’s beard or Teddy Roosevelt’s chin? (No, but he was young and less thoughtful.) Did it get unbearably cold? (Never enough to need long underwear.) To those curious about his place in history, he says little. Would he liken himself to those who laboured at Stonehenge, the pyramids or China’s Great Wall? He hasn’t considered it. 
A ranger addresses one topic he neglects. Mount Rushmore arguably produces the greatest returns of any public project, he tells a small crowd. The grand scheme finished under-budget and earlier than many expected. It cost less than $1m (in 1940s money) and even posted back a $388 surplus to the federal government. The site now draws 2.3m tourists yearly, quite a boon in a rural spot. Visitors may come for centuries yet. After the dust settled, Mr Clifford and his fellow workers left a towering legacy. ■
