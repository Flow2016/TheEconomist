TEÓFILO TORRES sits on a coffin, leaning against a Puerto Rican flag. He is dressed as Pateco, the gravedigger. According to folk history, Pateco buried the dead from Hurricane San Ciriaco, which ravaged the island in 1899. “I already buried Ricky Rosselló,” he says. “This is the coffin for Wanda.” 
“Ricky”, or Ricardo Rosselló, the island’s governor, announced his resignation on July 24th. Wanda Vázquez, the justice secretary, was theoretically next in line, though she says she does not want the job. Then on July 31st Mr Rosselló nominated Pedro Pierluisi, who lost to him in the 2016 primaries, to replace him. As The Economist went to press on August 1st, Mr Pierluisi’s nomination process was just starting and seemed sure to be contested in the legislature. It was unclear who will actually sit in the governor’s mansion next. Mr Rosselló’s resignation, which came after weeks of protests sparked by the leaking of text messages in which he mocked his constituents, has pushed America’s biggest territory into a succession crisis. 
Removing Mr Rosselló was cathartic, but Puerto Rico has deeper problems. It has suffered from years of economic mismanagement, a bloated public sector and high levels of poverty. The island has long failed to capitalise on its many assets, from its natural beauty to the artistic creativity of its people, which was on display in the placards, costumes and music of the protests. Hurricane Maria, which hit in 2017, made things worse, sparking mass emigration to the United States mainland. The government debt, which exceeds $120bn, including pension liabilities, is suffocating. The Washington-appointed Oversight Board has completed two deals to restructure some of the debt this year. 
Mr Rosselló’s departure has focused attention on one of Puerto Rico’s most significant problems. Fuelled by two-party machine politics, corruption has been endemic for generations. Politicians on both sides offer sweetheart deals to their friends in business, which in turn generates the money needed to get elected. “The political system basically created an institutional infrastructure that promotes behaviour which will lead to corruption sooner or later,” explains José Villamil, an economist. 
On July 10th the FBI arrested six individuals, including two members of the administration, for directing $15.5m to favoured businessmen. Douglas Leff, head of the San Juan division of the FBI, told Radio Isla: “It’s going to be a very busy summer for us.” A week later the Centre of Investigative Journalism (CPI, from its Spanish initials), which originally published the leaked messages that led to the governor’s downfall, reported that three of his associates, Elías Sánchez, Carlos Bermúdez and Edwin Miranda, had benefited in various ways from their friendship with Mr Rosselló. All three deny wrongdoing. 
If Mr Pierluisi’s appointment is blocked, finding a better replacement for Mr Rosselló could be hard. Few prominent politicians are free from accusations of corruption. It is not just Ms Vázquez who does not want the job of being governor. Several others have ruled themselves out until Puerto Rico holds elections in 2020. Taking the job is “political suicide”, says Carla Minet, the chief editor of the CPI. 
Whoever becomes governor, they will need to work to dismantle the system of patronage that has built up over years. Apart from the practice of favouring allies with government contracts, politicians have a habit of replacing officials across the government machinery with their own cronies every time there is a transfer of power. That means a loss of expertise each time. 
The new governor will not find things easy. Reform is not always popular, especially in the public sector, which is a sore point for many Puerto Ricans. The protests that helped push out Mr Rosselló could easily restart. Traditionally Puerto Rico’s people have split between those who support statehood and those who are happy to see it remain a commonwealth, under American jurisdiction but with no vote in Congress. But anger with the government has unified both sides. 
For now, the mood on the island is elation. “People are not sleeping any more”, says Gerardo Alvarado León, a reporter for El Nuevo Día, a newspaper, fresh from his first solid night’s sleep in weeks. But when the buzz fades, Puerto Ricans will need to find other ways to keep up the pressure. Ending graft will require deep civic engagement. The creativity shown in the protests will go far. After years of tolerating corruption, Puerto Ricans have decided they will no longer put up with it. They need a leadership which agrees. ■
