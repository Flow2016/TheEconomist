FOLLOWING EIGHT weeks of protests and mounting violence, the news that the authorities in Beijing planned to hold a rare press conference had many in Hong Kong holding their breath. The result was a (welcome) anti-climax. There were no threats to send in the army, as some had feared. A speech by the spokesperson from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office made no mention of that until, when asked by a journalist whether troops could be deployed on the streets he simply pointed to the relevant sections of Hong Kong-related laws. While condemning the violence of recent protests he took care not to criticise the local government and heaped praise on the work of the Hong Kong police. 
Communist Party newspapers are a better place to look for evidence of the party’s growing frustration. The People’s Daily ordered the police to have no “psychological worries” about being much tougher. Activists are already being punished. After a weekend of violent confrontations between young pro-democracy protesters and police using tear-gas and rubber bullets, 44 people arrested during the clashes were told they would be charged with rioting. They face up to ten years in prison. 
The forceful stance of the police has not quelled the demonstrations. Indeed, many gathered outside police stations to protest against the severity of the charges. The administration of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, is paralysed, those at the very top of it privately admit. Extraordinarily, Mrs Lam herself has not made any public statements for over a week. Although the Communist Party has reiterated its support, her days are surely numbered, even if it cannot accept her immediate resignation without a huge loss of face. 
As for the police, some complain privately about poor leadership. Many officers are livid at being put on the front line to sort out what they say is a political crisis. But as the provocations of black-shirted protesters mounted, it was clear that by the weekend plenty of officers were itching for revenge. After applications to march over the weekend in the central business district and Yuen Long—a suburb where pro-China thugs had beaten up innocent travellers a week earlier—were rejected, activists went ahead anyway. The police showed little restraint. Amnesty International, a human-rights watchdog, says it has seen “repeated instances where police officers were the aggressors”. 
After a wave of arrests, protesters may be more cautious—although at least seven marches are planned for August 5th alone. Meanwhile, there is not much the police can do should tactics switch to a campaign of low-level civil disobedience—strikes, sit-ins and so on. Civil servants, firemen, bus drivers and many more have backed one of the protesters’ chief demands: an independent inquiry into the crisis. 
The obvious and perhaps only way to resolve the crisis would be for China to keep its promise to let the people of Hong Kong choose their own leaders. Dream on. The radicalisation of the protests is, in part, a consequence of China’s strategy of persecuting more moderate opposition leaders trying to work within the system. 
For now, China is out to define its enemies in Hong Kong and delegitimise them. In the propaganda, Hong Kong’s quest for genuine self-rule is being portrayed as on a par with “splittists” elsewhere on China’s fringes, in Tibet or Xinjiang. It is in this nationalist context that students from the mainland have recently clashed with ones from Hong Kong on campuses in America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. 
Back in Hong Kong, China can always resort to the ultimate sanction: deploying the local garrison of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). That prospect was highlighted by Mrs Lam’s predecessor as chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, long close to the Communist Party. In a letter to the Financial Times last month he insisted that the PLA’s presence in Hong Kong is “not meant to be token, ceremonial or symbolic” but rather to help maintain public order. Yet deploying the PLA to crush largely peaceful protests would only deepen the government’s illegitimacy in locals’ eyes, while attracting enormous international opprobrium. That it is even being discussed is a sign of how bad things have become. ■
