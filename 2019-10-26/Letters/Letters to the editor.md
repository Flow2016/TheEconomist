The question of whether criticism of Israel can be disentangled from anti-Semitism is an empty one (Graphic detail, October 12th). To criticise Israel and its policies is perfectly kosher. Every newspaper, including in Israel, does it every day. But saying things like Israel is the greatest danger to peace in the world, or that it is an abnormality and should be peacefully dissolved— sentiments that were emailed by German academics to the Israeli embassy in Berlin—go further than this and are examples of the latest incarnation of anti-Semitism. 
There are limits to the statistical examination of anti-Semitism you wrote about. To ask people on the street what they think about Jews produces doubtful results and in the end leaves the matter unexplained. Mixing questions on attitudes towards Jews with other issues only causes confusion. 
Anti-Semitism is a historical phenomenon, a negative attitude towards Jews and Judaism deeply rooted in Western culture. Over the centuries it has changed themes, but remains basically the same negative cultural value. In the Middle Ages Jew-hatred was mainly religious (its answer to the “Jewish Question” was conversion to Christianity). In modern times it became secular and adopted racial tones. In the 20th century, this came mostly from the right of the political spectrum. 
One reason for much of today’s misunderstanding about anti-Semitism is that it is undergoing another thematic change. A lot of today’s Jew-hatred is directed against the most evident symbol of continuing Jewish vitality: the state of Israel. And much of this Israelisation of Jew-hatred originates in the centre-left and the left. The anti-Semitic tropes uttered in the British Labour Party are far from being the exception.

The numbering of homes in rural France needn’t rest on the archaic logic of Napoleonic systems (“The view from No 2027”, September 28th). The baffling metric numbering system used in French villages could be remedied by using What3Words. This app has comprehensively mapped the entire world by giving any position on the planet a unique three-word combination. Recently deployed by delivery drivers in Nigeria, it could also be helpful in the somewhat more Amazon-friendly terrain of rural France. 
Every philosopher has his time and place. Perhaps the days of relying solely on Cartesian address conventions are numbered, ironically by words.

As you report, African languages are spreading to northern latitudes (“The other African-Americans”, October 19th). Perhaps knowledge of African linguistics should spread, too. Another recent article, on the pope in Africa, describes a stand-off between the pontiff and a Nigerian diocese where a bishop-elect was seen as an ethnic and linguistic outsider (“Stony ground”, September 7th). Whatever the perceptions, let me assure you that the bishop and his potential flock were all speakers, like me, of the Igbo language, whose dialects differ no more than, say, the Geordie and Scouse forms of English.

What a pleasure to read “Tiny democracy” (October 5th), about people who have been randomly chosen to sit on civic institutions in Belgium’s German-speaking area. This method was used successfully by Britain’s lottery charities board and its successor between 1998 and 2004 to choose some members of nine regional panels, which dispensed many millions of pounds. In 2003 a parliamentary committee examined its workings and called for a wider experiment, but this was rejected and a year later the panels disappeared. 
A citizen’s involvement in civic affairs is meritorious. In “Democracy in America”, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote perceptively of randomly chosen juries as forms of political institutions. He concluded that the jury “is both the most efficient way of establishing the people’s rule and the most efficient way of teaching them how to rule.” Unlike referendums.

Yes, more of the financial industry is being automated, which is the evolutionary nature of every business (“March of the machines”, October 5th). The good news is that humans are not going away. There is no substitute for human interaction, judgment and experience. I doubt there are any trading operations with zero human oversight; someone has to press the stop button to turn a malfunctioning system off. After all, a fool with a tool is still a fool. 
As for the stability of the financial system, particularly equity markets, the answer has been staring us in the face for some time. Does share trading have to be continuous? Is faster always better? A good market needs to be efficient and fair, not necessarily faster. Introducing a periodic single-price auction (SPA) trading mechanism in place of the continuous system we have today would reduce the risks of future market meltdowns. It would also obviate the insane speed-trading arms race. 
Almost as ridiculous as microsecond trade executions is the speed-bump mechanism used to slow things down. A SPA market mechanism would not only be more elegant, it would also provide more liquidity, as it would concentrate trading interest both in time and place. 
This would help deal with the question of market fragmentation. Do we really need so many markets to trade? With trade executions essentially a commodity (for equities at least), one could argue that the execution of business in a SPA-oriented market should be a regulated utility, whether member-owned or not.

Granted, computers can do many things in finance quicker and better than any human. However, programming a computer to run an index fund is child’s play compared with teaching it what to do when one of Donald Trump’s tweets declaring a new trade war sends everyone running for the exit. An experienced trader instinctively knows that the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. How do you build that truth into an algorithm?

You said that the first transatlantic cable ran between Liverpool and New York, carrying cotton prices, and was completed in 1866 (“Masters of the universe”, October 5th). In fact, the first transatlantic cable was laid between Valentia Island in Ireland and Newfoundland. After several attempts, it delivered its first message in 1858.
