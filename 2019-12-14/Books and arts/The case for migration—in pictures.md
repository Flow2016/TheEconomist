Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration. By Bryan Caplan. Illustrated by Zach Weinersmith. First Second; 256 pages; $19.99. St Martin’s Press; £15.99. 
ECONOMISTS DO NOT normally write cartoon books. But Bryan Caplan of George Mason University wanted to make a radical argument to the widest possible audience. So he teamed up with Zach Weinersmith, an illustrator with a bold and cheerful brush. The result is a brilliant distillation of the moral, economic and practical arguments for open borders. 
It starts with an uncomfortable thought-experiment. Suppose a desperately hungry man called Marvin wanted to walk to a market to buy food—and another man, Sam, prevented him at gunpoint, knowing that he would starve as a consequence. Wouldn’t that be murder? And if what Sam did is wrong, why is it all right for Uncle Sam to do something very similar to would-be immigrants? 
Migration is by far the most effective route out of poverty. Yet all rich countries make it extremely hard, dooming the Marvins of the world to remain in places where life is shorter and more wretched. Governments in rich countries are not merely refusing to help the poor. They are forcibly preventing them from helping themselves. 
Advocates of immigration restrictions—ie, nearly everyone in rich countries—predict that free movement would spell disaster. Mr Caplan explains why this is unlikely, and how better policies could make it vanishingly so. Are immigrants a burden on taxpayers? Only if the host country’s policies allow or encourage them to be. He lays out the fiscal contributions of current migrants, depending on their age and skills, and of a theoretical future mix of new arrivals. His argument is sophisticated and footnoted, but jargon-free and illustrated in a way that helps even readers with no economic training to follow it. 
The format is surprisingly effective. The chapter on philosophical arguments for and against open borders features a cartoon John Stuart Mill debating with Mr Caplan, plus Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Lee Kuan Yew and Jesus. The author puts the strongest arguments against his position into the mouths of sympathetic Everymen and -women, and rebuts them respectfully. 
Having set out a maximalist goal—completely free movement—Mr Caplan explores intermediate steps in that direction. For each objection he offers a solution that is less harmful than keeping immigrants out. Worried that they will freeload? Make them pay more taxes or exclude them from most welfare benefits. Concerned that they won’t learn English? Insist that they do, as a condition of entry. Many other books on this topic are angry and hectoring; this one delivers a deeply moral message in a playful tone, interspersed with humour. Schools and colleges should use it not only as the starting point for a civil debate on migration, but also as an example of how to hold such debates in general. ■
