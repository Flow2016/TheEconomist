FINLAND NOW has the world’s youngest serving prime minister. On December 10th Sanna Marin (pictured, second from right), who is 34, was sworn in at the head of a coalition whose four other component parties are also led by women. Three of them are also in their 30s. Strikes toppled the previous prime minister last week.
