FRANTZ FANON, a great theorist of colonialism, wrote that “every colonised people...finds itself face to face with the language of the civilising nation.” This confrontation can persist years after independence. Just ask Morocco. Some in the former French colony are up in arms over a law reintroducing French as a language of instruction in schools. It is a return “to the language of the coloniser”, said Abdelilah Benkirane, a former prime minister. 
Most of the law in question, passed on August 2nd, is uncontroversial. It aims to reform Morocco’s dysfunctional education system. But article two allows for the teaching of science, maths and technical subjects in French (and other languages). Whereas most Moroccans speak Darija (or Moroccan Arabic), French is the language of business, government and higher education. The measure aims to equip students for this reality. 
The controversy is more about politics than pedagogy. Morocco’s two official languages are modern standard Arabic (MSA) and Tamazight (the Berber tongue). Many feel that only MSA is suitable for teaching. Even the inclusion of a few words of Darija in a textbook last year caused an uproar. Members of the Islamist Justice and Development Party, such as Mr Benkirane, now fear the “Frenchification” of education. 
Plenty of Moroccans, though, see merit in the law. In 2016 King Mohammed VI blessed the idea of teaching in French. Around half of university students fail to complete their studies, in part because of trouble with the language. The risk is that the new measure will be implemented poorly, frustrating pupils. As it is, only 53% of middle-school pupils continue to high school. 
Saïd Amzazi, the minister of education, says he wants schools to produce “citizens of the world”. In that case, though, he might be better off holding classes in English or Chinese, which are more prominent in academia and the global economy. Next-door Algeria has ordered its universities to teach in English rather than French. 
Over 60 years after independence, Morocco is still working out its relationship with France. The two countries maintain close economic ties and the current government in Rabat is particularly Francophile. In a speech on Bastille Day, Saad Eddine El Othmani, the prime minister, waxed lyrical about the countries’ “exceptional relationship”. The anger provoked by article two shows that this view is far from universal.■
