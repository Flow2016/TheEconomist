IT IS, AT first glance, an odd way to do things. Universities in England decide early in the year whether to make offers to applicants, before they have any idea of how well they have done in their school-leaving exams, known as A-levels, which are taken in the summer. Instead, would-be students provide their marks in earlier tests, a “personal statement” boasting of their brilliance and—most controversially—the A-level grades their teachers expect them to get. Universities then make offers that are usually conditional on the student achieving certain grades in the summer. This year’s applicants found out if they had made the cut on August 15th. 
They may be among the last to go through the unusual process. This week the Labour Party threw its support behind an alternative system, in which prospective students would apply to university after they had received their grades. Such a move is already backed by the UCU, a trade union for lecturers, and the Sutton Trust, an influential education charity. Universities UK, which represents universities, and the OFS, the higher-education regulator, are also considering reforms. 
It is not hard to find flaws in the current system. Evidence suggests teachers over-predict the grades that less well-off pupils will achieve—except when it comes to the cleverest, whom they tend to underestimate. Having pupils apply before they know their results makes it harder to get unconfident ones to aim high, says Anna Vignoles, an education academic at Cambridge University. Applying with actual results might also reduce the importance of personal statements, which gives an edge to those with pushy parents or teachers. 
University bureaucrats worry about the upheaval involved in Labour’s proposal. If the application process were squeezed into the existing timetable, some dons would have to spend the summer screening applicants rather than doing research (or enjoying the sun). It would also put applicants under pressure to make a life-changing decision very quickly. Mike Nicholson, head of admissions at the University of Bath, worries that speeding up the process would make it hard for universities to tailor offers to the background of applicants, as most now do. 
Many of these problems could be solved by a more radical rejigging of the university calendar, perhaps with the academic year starting in January (as it already does for some postgraduate and international students) rather than September. And the switch to a post-qualification admissions process ought eventually to mean less work for universities. Under the current system pupils apply to up to five universities, to insure against better- or worse-than-expected results. If they knew their results when applying they would probably apply to fewer places, meaning less paperwork for the universities. In 2011 an estimate by UCAS, the national body that runs admissions, suggested that such a change could save universities £18m ($29m) a year. 
The system is already moving in the direction of post-qualification admissions. Last year one in ten students got a place after receiving their results, via a system known as clearing. This has long been a way for students who miss their grades to find a last-minute alternative place. Now it is sometimes used to trade up, when pupils approach higher-ranked universities after getting better-than-expected grades. Another recent shift has been a sharp rise in the number of unconditional offers, as universities compete to attract students (much to the concern of teachers, who fear that no-strings offers make pupils slack off in their exams). A change of admissions systems would be difficult. But even some vice-chancellors are starting to think that it might be worthwhile. ■
