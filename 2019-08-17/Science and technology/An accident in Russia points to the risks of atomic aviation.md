IN 1957 WORK began on Project Pluto, a treetop-skimming American missile loaded with hydrogen bombs. Nothing odd about that, except that the missile itself was also to be propelled by nuclear energy. A reactor on board would suck in air, heat and thus expand it, and then hurl it out of the back to provide thrust. Unfortunately, this also spewed out radioactive particles—which would hardly matter in war, but meant the missile could not be tested safely, and so the project was cancelled. 
America’s experience has not, however, deterred Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. In March 2018 he announced the development of a Pluto-like missile called Burevestnik (“petrel”, a bird regarded by sailors of old as a harbinger of storms). This has since been tested in Novaya Zemlya, and has crashed several times. 
On August 8th there was another accident ascribed by many observers to Burevestnik. Seven scientists perished in a rocket explosion on an offshore platform near Arkhangelsk. The damage was widespread. Some reports suggest that on August 13th Nyonoksa, a village 40km away, was almost evacuated after radiation there exceeded background levels. 
As Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, observes, nuclear propulsion can work in two ways. One is fission reaction—the sort used in power stations. But, as Project Pluto’s designers found, that is tricky to fit in a missile. 
The other option is radioisotope decay, which uses a substance such as polonium-218 to heat and evaporate a liquid. The gas generated might be employed to propel probes through the vacuum of space, but because it produces less thrust than fission the process has not been thought suitable for missiles. Mr Elleman hypothesises, however, that Russia may use it for another purpose: to create a long-lasting thermal battery which can provide unlimited electrical power for tasks such as missile guidance and warhead initiation. 
Russia has admitted that an “isotope power source” was being tested, and Rosatom, the country’s atomic-energy agency, has said a “nuclear battery” was involved. Some Russian sources suggest it was this—rather than a reactor—which failed, exploding when it was pulled from the water. 
Why go to such trouble in the first place? Russia has ballistic missiles that can reach any part of the world, but it is worried that they may be vulnerable to current or future American defences. Cruise missiles can fly along low, erratic paths capable of skirting those defences. But Russia’s longest-range cruise missile, Kalibr, can travel only a few thousand kilometres, so hitting America would require launching it from planes, ships or submarines. Burevestnik, by contrast, could be fired from deep inside Russian territory, and would thus be a more credible threat. 
Pranay Vaddi, an arms-control expert at the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank, suggests it might also serve as a bargaining chip. “This may be an effort to gain leverage in arms-control negotiations, to force the United States to the table,” he says. New Start, a treaty that limits American and Russian nuclear forces, covers only ballistic missiles. America does not seem keen on renewing it when it expires in 2021. The Russians may hope that Burevestnik will change America’s attitude—if they can make it work.■
