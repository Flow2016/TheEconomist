You Know You Want This By Kristen Roupenian. Gallery/Scout Press; 240 pages; $24.99. Jonathan Cape; £12.99. 
FOR A LITERARY sensation, the short story had an unassuming title. “Cat Person” portrayed the flirting and eventual date between Margot, a 20-year-old college student, and 34-year-old Robert (the supposed feline enthusiast of the title). Their relationship culminates in strange and unpleasant—but not violent or coercive—sex. The tale was published in the New Yorker in December 2017, just as the #MeToo movement began to encourage women to speak up about harassment, assault and abuses of power. It inspired a glut of opinion pieces, plus a satirical retelling from Robert’s perspective, and may well be the most-read piece of fiction in the history of the magazine. 
Little surprise, then, that there was a bidding war for Kristen Roupenian’s first book, “You Know You Want This”. The collection of stories (some of which, like “Cat Person”, have been published before) circles around themes of desire, pain, obsession and transgression. “Inspired by a small but nasty encounter” of her own, the fable that made Ms Roupenian’s name resonated with many female readers’ experiences of 21st-century dating. Most of the tales in this volume are much darker and more disturbing. Many of them are shot through with moments of black comedy. 
Ms Roupenian often peers behind the bedroom curtain: at the woman who wants to be punched and kicked by strangers during foreplay; at the couple who are titillated, then fixated, by the idea of their carnal embraces being overheard; at the man who can achieve tumescence only by pretending “that his dick was a knife, and the woman he was fucking was stabbing herself with it”. Yet the women in these pages are not all victimised and manipulated. Many are aggressors in their own right. 
In “Sardines”, Tilly, a ten-year-old girl, makes a monstrous birthday wish borne of the bullying she had endured and abandonment by her father. Ellie, the protagonist of “Biter”, longs to sink her teeth into a new colleague’s “sweet and gamy flesh”. When he kisses her against her will at the Christmas party, she rips a chunk of skin from his cheekbone. She changes jobs regularly, “because, as Ellie quickly learned, there was one in every office”—a creep who provides a chance for her own form of predation. 
“You Know You Want This” at once enchants and horrifies. Ms Roupenian’s occasional supernatural touches can be distracting, but at its best her writing recalls the gloomy feminist fairy-tales of Angela Carter. This collection cements her reputation as one of the most startling new voices in fiction.
