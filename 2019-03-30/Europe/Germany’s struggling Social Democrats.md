# Germany’s struggling Social Democrats 
##### Germany’s oldest political party cannot find a way out of the mire

FEW POLITICAL PARTIES have a history like that of Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD). Founded in the late 19th century, the SPD heroically if briefly resisted Hitler’s rise. After the war it reinvented itself as a big-tent Volkspartei (people’s party). In office it modernised West Germany, soothed cold-war tensions and inspired similar movements abroad. In 1998 it still commanded over 40% of the vote. 
It has had a rough time since. After a losing to Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in 2005, a string of poor results reached a nadir in 2017, when the SPD took barely 20% of the vote, its worst result since the war. After an agonised internal debate, the party agreed to rejoin the coalition in which it had served with the CDU (and its sister party, the Christian Social Union) since 2013. That failed to arrest the slide. Today the party languishes behind the Greens and has vied for third place with the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). In parts of Germany it has shrivelled to almost nothing. 
The decline of social democracy across Europe is well documented. The institutions, especially organised labour, that in West Germany’s case funnelled millions of votes to the SPD in the glory years of the late 1960s and 1970s (see chart) have withered. In a fragmented society it is harder to build the blue- and white-collar coalitions that delivered the party’s most recent victories, to Gerhard Schröder, Mrs Merkel’s predecessor. Outside Iberia and Britain, social-democratic parties are struggling almost everywhere in Europe. Yet the SPD’s history and influence mean its distress stands out.

During the long Merkel years the SPD has found it hard to establish an identity. It chalked up victories in government, such as the introduction of a national minimum wage in 2015, but failed to get much credit for them. Today just 16% of German voters say the SPD has the strongest imprint on the coalition, next to 62% for the CDU/CSU. “It’s a deep-rooted rejection of the present government,” says Kevin Kühnert, head of the SPD’s youth wing, who led a campaign against rejoining the coalition last year. 
People are another problem. Andrea Nahles (pictured), the SPD’s leader, is a canny strategist but unpopular with colleagues and voters. Olaf Scholz, the vice-chancellor and finance minister, exudes competence and ambition but struggles to shake off his robotic “Scholz-omat” reputation. In matchups, both lose to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who took over from Mrs Merkel as CDU boss in December. The SPD got through eight leaders during Mrs Merkel’s 18 years at the top of the CDU. 
Yet its problems run deeper than people. Most trace them to Mr Schröder’s labour-market reforms, especially “Hartz IV”, which toughened rules on unemployment benefits. The policy is often credited with helping create a jobs miracle, but it infuriated the party’s base in areas such as the post-industrial Ruhr. The SPD lost over 10m voters between 1998 and 2009, and arguments festered among those who stayed. 
To heal the wounds, last month Ms Nahles proposed replacing Hartz IV with a “citizens’ payment”, extending the period in which a portion of previous salaries is paid to claimants, and raising the minimum wage. This has lifted the party’s spirits, as has a (more realistic) push for bigger state pensions. “Our profile in government is now sharper, and I appreciate it,” says Malu Dreyer, the SPD premier of Rhineland-Palatinate. The polling bump earned by this moderate leftward tilt quickly vanished. Yet party leaders think they have found a sweet spot in which they can pick fights with the CDU on selected issues, brandishing their social-justice credentials without angering voters by paralysing the government. Papers on a jobs-friendly climate policy, elderly care and social cohesion are promised later this year. 
The leadership hopes to bolster morale before a review of the coalition at the end of the year, which could offer party hacks who never wanted to rejoin the government a chance to pull out. For the moment Ms Nahles’s efforts have calmed people’s nerves. But the mood could turn jittery again should the SPD do badly in elections this year. Losing power in Bremen (which votes in May) and Brandenburg (September) would be especially painful. 
The strategy may see off the internal critics for a while. But the appeal of softening welfare rules is limited when unemployment is below 4%; boosting pensions does little for younger voters, just 9% of whom believe the SPD best serves their interests. “I was born in 1985, where’s the social system for me?” asks Laura-Kristine Krause, a party member and political activist. On other issues the SPD can resemble a think-tank more than a power-hungry party. There are good ideas floating around the party’s brains trusts on matters like automation and the future of work, but little apparent appetite to translate them into a coherent set of vote-winning policies. 
The picture is yet dimmer on foreign policy. As Germany comes under pressure from allies, above all America, to meet its NATO responsibilities, the SPD spies an opportunity to market itself as the “party of peace”, opposing big rises in defence spending and a relaxation of arms-export rules. The SPD’s slogan for the European elections, “Europe is the answer”, sits awkwardly with the irritation its foreign policy stirs in its EU partners, especially France. No matter; the party is in line with voters’ instincts. “You need something for the heart as well as the brain,” says an insider. 
Immigration and identity politics, however, present trickier terrain. Leaders hope that as the dust settles from the refugee crisis of 2015-16 they can steer the national conversation on to social and labour issues. But immigration remains German voters’ top priority. This speaks to perhaps the SPD’s broadest problem. More than any other party it has literally shed votes left (The Left), right (AfD) and centre (Greens, CDU and the liberal Free Democrats). That makes it hard to alight on a single strategy to win people back: trying to seduce AfD voters with a tougher line on migration, for example, alienates defectors to the Greens. 
Party bigwigs accept that the days of 40% support are gone for good. But with 25% of the vote (not completely impossible), it might lead a leftist coalition with the Greens and The Left, although their collective support has shrunk considerably (see chart). Others want to hug the FDP closer. Yet all this is for the future. For now the SPD is stuck in a grim present, torn between constituencies, lacking leadership and bereft of election-winning ideas.
