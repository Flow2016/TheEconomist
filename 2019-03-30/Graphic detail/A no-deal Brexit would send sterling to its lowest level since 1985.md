REGARDLESS OF WHAT they tell you, traders struggle to explain short-term fluctuations in the value of currencies. Recently, however, the pound has become an exception. Every time it seems more likely that Britain will leave the EU without a deal, sterling falls against the dollar. 
The strength of this link can be measured statistically, thanks to a helpful proxy for the odds of no-deal. On January 16th a market opened on Betfair Exchange, a betting website, on whether Britain will crash out by March 29th, the original Brexit deadline. Punters have bet £3.9m ($5.1m). 
On March 21st the EU extended this deadline, causing the chances of no-deal by the end of March to fall to near zero. But for the 64 days between the opening of the market and the granting of the extension, the odds seemed to mirror the exchange rate. For each ten-percentage-point rise in the probability of no-deal, the pound lost $0.02, and vice versa. As sterling moved between $1.28 and $1.33, it was possible to predict the exchange rate from Betfair's odds with an average error of just one cent. 
This correlation is robust enough to allow for educated guesses about where the pound might land if Britain crashes out. If the same relationship were to hold, in the event of no-deal, there would be a 95% chance sterling would fall from its current price of $1.32 to between $1.08 (last reached in 1985) and $1.18. The most likely value would be $1.13. 
The same method can be applied to other markets with strong links to no-deal odds. Among the assets we tested, the biggest winner from no-deal would be gold, with an expected gain of 9%. The worst losers would be domestic British banks, which are heavily exposed to the housing market. For each rise of ten percentage points in Betfair's no-deal price, the average share price of Lloyds and RBS has fallen by 5.4% of their current value. This implies that no-deal would cut them nearly in half. 
Surprisingly, the method finds that no-deal would set British and Irish bonds on opposite paths. A crash-out would hit Ireland's debt hard, causing the gap between its interest rate and Germany's to rise from 0.6 percentage points to 1.4. In contrast, British yields would fall from 1.0% to 0.6%. 
One cause of this divergence is that Britain, unlike Ireland, sets its own monetary policy. Facing an adverse shock, the Bank of England can cut interest rates and use quantitative easing, boosting bond prices. The European Central Bank, however, sets policy for the entire EUro zone, not just for countries such as Ireland that would be particularly badly harmed by no-deal. 
Our figures are uncertain. Correlations that look robust within a small range of no-deal prices could fail outside it. But unless no-deal becomes more likely, forecasts of its impact require tenuous assumptions. As George Box, a statistician, said, all models are wrong, but some are useful.
