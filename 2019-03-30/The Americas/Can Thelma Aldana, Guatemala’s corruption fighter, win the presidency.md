# Can Thelma Aldana, Guatemala’s corruption fighter, win the presidency?

THELMA ALDANA’S elevation to the status of heroine was sudden. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a UN-backed body that helps prosecutors with corruption cases, described as “unsuitable” her appointment to the supreme court in 2009. When she became attorney-general in 2014, many Guatemalans worried that she was too close to the government. Those doubts dissolved in 2015, when she worked with CICIG to uncover a scandal that led to the resignation of the president, Otto Pérez Molina. Ms Aldana jailed some 250 people before leaving office in 2018. She launched an investigation of the current president, Jimmy Morales, for campaign-finance violations in 2015, and of members of his family on other charges. (They deny wrongdoing.) 
That record has made Ms Aldana the de facto leader of a movement composed of activists, judges and friendly foreigners, which seeks to establish the rule of law in a country whose leading lights often have criminal connections. It has grown in confidence. Ms Aldana is a candidate in the presidential election, whose first round is scheduled for June 16th. Although she is second in the polls, she could win a run-off in August. She “would be the first president that [Guatemala’s oligarchs] can’t control,” says Edgar Ortíz Romero, a professor at Francisco Marroquín University.  
They may be trying to stop her. On March 19th a judge issued a warrant for her arrest on charges of embezzlement and tax fraud. Her supporters claim the charge is politically motivated. An electoral official told CNN that “a large majority” of political parties pressed him to keep Ms Aldana and her party, Semilla (Seed), off the ballot. 
Ms Aldana, who denies wrongdoing, fled to El Salvador. She is expected to return if the electoral court reaffirms her immunity, to which she is entitled as a candidate. 
The charges against her raise the stakes in an election that was already bound to be momentous. It pits her promise to renew Guatemala’s democracy against efforts by a worried ruling class to entrench its power. Much depends on whether Ms Aldana stays on the ballot. 
The roots of Guatemala’s dysfunction are in its 36-year civil war, one of Latin America’s bloodiest, which ended in the 1990s. Some 200,000 people died. Unlike in El Salvador, where a stalemate led to the creation of two post-war parties that have held each other (imperfectly) accountable, in Guatemala the left-wing guerrillas were beaten decisively. The parties that emerged from the war are numerous and weak, producing gridlock in congress. No party has won more than 5% of the vote in all of the past three presidential elections.  
In this jumble, corruption flourishes. During the war (but after the end of military rule) black-ops groups infiltrated the state. After the war they focused on profit. Congressmen and mayors team up to put in their pockets some of the money meant for local infrastructure projects. A corrupt network of officers, businessmen and politicians became the main nexus of power. Half of campaign donations come from firms with state contracts; 25% is from organised crime. 
In 2006 the government invited CICIG to Guatemala to break up the cabal. At first it just investigated drug-trafficking and atrocities committed during the civil war. Iván Velásquez, a Colombian who became its chief in 2013, took the “important leap” of taking on corruption cases, says Eduardo Stein, Guatemala’s vice-president from 2004 to 2008. The cause became popular. Mr Pérez was pushed out of the presidency with the help of 100,000 protesters.  
The establishment views CICIG as an unelected foreign agency that is taking over the state, and Ms Aldana as its tool. Mr Morales, a former comedian who has surrounded himself with ex-army officers, refused to renew its mandate, which expires in September. The Trump administration did not object loudly. In January Mr Morales tried to force CICIG out of the country. When judges from the constitutional court blocked that effort, congress tried to strip them of their immunity. Some observers fault Mr Velásquez and Ms Aldana for going after members of Mr Morales’s family for what is not clearly a serious crime. 
Some members of Guatemala’s elite regard the anti-graft campaign as part of a broader attack on peace and prosperity. Business complains that the state’s aggressive recent efforts to collect the taxes it is owed endanger growth and that courts are issuing rulings that damage enterprise. 
Guatemala’s reckoning with its past has also become part of the conflict between reformers and the right. Conservatives back a proposal in congress to give an amnesty to 30 former army officers jailed for human-rights abuses. That will encourage national reconciliation, they claim. Human-rights activists see it as part of a backlash by the establishment, intensified by Ms Aldana’s political rise. “We are in this crisis because we touched the heart of the deep state,” says Martín Rodríguez Pellecer, editor of Nómada, a news website. 
The charges against Ms Aldana concern a payment early in her tenure as attorney-general to a university dean for staff training that allegedly never took place. The 20,000-quetzal ($2,600) fee looks abnormally high for such work. Few people deny that the case raises questions. One local journalist suggests that the payment is “a remnant of her time on the dark side of the moon”, before she became an anti-corruption crusader.  
Both of Ms Aldana’s main rivals for the presidency have legal problems. Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efrain Ríos Montt, a dictator during the civil war, may be barred from running. The constitution bans relatives of putschists from seeking the presidency (never mind that Ms Ríos ran in 2015, and that Ríos Montt himself ran in 2003). Sandra Torres, a former first lady who is leading in the polls, frightens the elite less than does Ms Aldana. She faces questions over financing of her unsuccessful run in 2015, although she, too, has immunity for now. 
Ms Aldana no doubt hopes to emulate recently elected left-of-centre presidents in Mexico and El Salvador, who railed against corruption during their campaigns. She has described herself as “of the right, but with advanced thoughts” (ie, an advocate of human rights). Her problem is that just half of Guatemalans live in cities, where worry about corruption is strongest. Anti-graft hashtags do not go viral in villages, where other needs are more pressing. Ms Aldana may have to broaden her message for rural voters.  
Even if she wins, her corruption fight will face obstacles. She would not take office until January, four months after CICIG’s mandate expires. She may need to find a way to re-establish it. 
This would be the first of many battles. Congress still needs fixing. Child malnutrition and water shortages persist. But more Guatemalans are coming to believe that the state will not solve such problems until it deals with corruption. They just might pick Ms Aldana to do the job.
