AFTER EIGHT years of civil war, Syria’s education system is a wreck. Nearly 3m school-age children, a third of the total, do not attend classes. That is, in part, because 40% of schools are unusable. Some have been damaged in the fighting; others are being used by armed groups or the displaced. The schools that still function are crammed and there are fewer teachers to run them—around 150,000 have fled or been killed. Unsurprisingly, students are way behind. Ten-year-olds in Syria read like five-year-olds in developed countries, says Save the Children, an aid agency. The literacy rate has plummeted. 
The consequences are stark. Syrians lack the skills needed to rebuild their country or to escape the grinding poverty in which 80% of them live. The uneducated are easier prey for jihadists and militiamen offering money and a bit of power, or for Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which will gladly give them a spot in the army. Shattered schools are yet another reason for more affluent Syrians to leave the country—and for those who have fled to stay abroad. “We’ll see the catastrophic results over the next decade as children become adults,” says Riyad al-Najem of Hurras, a charity that supports over 350 schools in Syria. 
At least seven different curricula compete in Syria. Opponents of Mr Assad purged the state’s syllabus of its paeans to the ruling Baath party. But they sparred over a common curriculum to replace it. The Kurds, who rule the north-east, imposed their own curriculum, replacing adulation of the Assads with adulation of Abdullah Ocalan, a jailed leader of Turkey’s Kurds. The Turks, meanwhile, have opened 11 religious secondary schools in the strip of Syria that they control. The Syriac Orthodox church and the jihadists of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Islamic State have opened their own schools, too. 
As the frontlines of the war shifted, children lurched between curricula. Certificates earned in one place are often not recognised by the authorities in other parts. That makes it hard for students to get into universities, almost all of which are in regime-held areas. Many simply drop out. In some parts of the country 50% of kids leave school by the age of 13 and 80% by the age of 16. Sometimes parents pull their children out in order to marry them off or have them work on the streets. “They’ll make the same wages for their rest of their lives and bring up their children to do the same,” says Harun Onder of the World Bank. 
Western donors have withheld aid from rebel-held areas in order to avoid helping terrorist groups, such as HTS, which controls Idlib province. In 2017 the European Union, which has invested €2bn in Syrian education since 2012, stopped all but emergency relief in areas controlled by the regime. A scheme to train teachers from Syria at the American University in Beirut was postponed after the EU backed away. “We don’t want to do anything which would legitimise the regime or the terrorists,” says an EU official. 
But withholding aid may help them. Syrians are being pushed into the arms of militants, says Mr Najem, who fears a rash of school closures. Massa Mufti, an education expert from Damascus who advises the UN, worries that there will be more bloodshed: “We are generating another cycle of radicalisation and violence.”
