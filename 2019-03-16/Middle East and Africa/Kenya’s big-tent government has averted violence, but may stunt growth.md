LITTLE OVER a year ago, Kenya seemed to be teetering. Swathes of the country refused to recognise Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured, left) as their president. Nearly 100 people had died in political violence after he was declared winner of a brace of elections in late 2017. The opposition’s leader, Raila Odinga (pictured, right), having rejected his rival’s victory in the original poll and boycotted a court-ordered re-run, had declared himself “the people’s president”. His coalition announced a plan of economic disruption and threatened the secession of opposition heartlands. With tribal animosity rising, another eruption of violence seemed possible. 
Then suddenly it was all over. The two men made up in March last year. So startling has the reconciliation been after a bitter 16-year rivalry that it has taken on a fairy-tale flavour. Instead of questioning the president’s legitimacy, Mr Odinga now attends rallies, funerals and church services with him, cheerleading all the way. Politicians from Mr Kenyatta’s dominant Kikuyu tribe are cock-a-hoop. Their nemesis had not been turned from a frog into a prince, thank heavens, but he had become something rather better: a toady. 
Fairy tales are usually heart-warming. They are also, by definition, unreal. Cold political and ethnic calculation lies behind this rapprochement. Mr Odinga, who is 74, has concluded he will never be allowed to defeat a Kikuyu, an ally says, after losing to one in four of the five elections in which his name appeared on the ballot. Sharing power is the best he can hope for. He has won Mr Kenyatta’s backing for a referendum to increase the number of executive posts, probably by creating a prime minister and two deputies. These could be earmarked for tribes that supported the opposition, including Mr Odinga’s Luo people. 
Mr Kenyatta wins, too. He has tamed his opponents, restored stability and given businesses confidence to invest. Growth has ticked up. Most crucially, the president has found an ally who could prevent his deputy, William Ruto, from succeeding him in 2022, when Mr Kenyatta is obliged to stand down. For many Kikuyu, Mr Ruto (a Kalenjin) represents a greater threat than Mr Odinga. Since independence in 1963, the Kikuyu, Kenya’s biggest tribe, have lost power only once, during the presidency of Daniel arap Moi from 1978 to 2002. Mr Moi, a Kalenjin, curbed the clout of the Kikuyus. They do not want a repeat. 
The reconciliation, known in Kenya as “the handshake”, is not without risk. It may not last if Mr Odinga does not get what he wants. And Kalenjin politicians are furious at what they see as a blatant attempt to shut them out of power. When the Kalenjin and Kikuyu last stood on opposing sides of the political divide, in the election of 2007, some 1,400 people were killed. Many Kikuyus live in the Kalenjin heartlands of the Rift Valley. Because they, rather than their political leaders, could face Kalenjin wrath, some are understandably nervous. 
The handshake also means Kenya no longer has a functioning opposition. Some fret that the country could in effect become a one-party state again. Few politicians seem bothered. They argue that confrontational democracy is a Western import that has endangered stability and hampered economic development. Kenya, says a close ally of Mr Kenyatta, would be much better off with a benevolent dictatorship. 
Besides, the argument goes, the status quo would be little changed. Commentators sometimes point to the number of political parties Kenya has as a sign of its democratic vibrancy. Some 117 contested the election in 2007 and 47 have won seats in parliament since the end of one-party rule in 1991. Yet Farah Maalim, a veteran MP, says he can think of only one occasion on which a serious opposition party differed in substance from the government of the day, when FORD-Kenya called for widespread land redistribution in the 1990s. The rest have nearly all been temporary vehicles designed to propel their leaders to power or build ethnic coalitions. Mr Odinga has belonged to six political parties, Mr Kenyatta to four. Between them they have formed five separate alliances. 
Still, the lack of even a flawed opposition is troubling. In Mr Kenyatta’s first term, MPs on the other side of the house sometimes opposed bills that threatened, for instance, to impose controls on the media and non-governmental organisations. There is much less genuine scrutiny now, MPs say. Worse, the vacuum left by the opposition has been filled by government factionalism. Messrs Kenyatta and Odinga have launched an ambitious anti-corruption drive. Powerful officials, including several cabinet ministers, have been called in to explain the suspected disappearance of funds. Yet, because many of those questioned are seen as Mr Ruto’s allies, some think that the war on corruption is a ploy to neuter the deputy president. 
Mr Ruto is suspected of getting his revenge by using his large parliamentary caucus to hold up government business. An attempt to rescue Kenya Airways, the unprofitable national carrier, may have stalled as a result. Plans to build houses, improve access to free health care and boost manufacturing and agriculture have all been delayed, victims of the infighting. 
Such paralysis is hardly beneficial. Perhaps more worryingly, Kenya’s faltering democratic progress is also in danger. Although the referendum, which could take place later this year, should broaden the ethnic inclusivity of the government, politicians could use it to weaken oversight bodies created under the constitution of 2010. If everyone is in government, few have an interest in transparency or accountability. 
Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that a lack of political competition retards economic development. Many Kenyans remember the stagnation of their own one-party era. As alluring as a big-tent government may seem, a jobs-for-all-the-boys political settlement is likely to foster worse governance. Every ruling party needs an opposition to keep it honest.
