ESKINDER NEGA founded his first newspaper, Ethiopis, in 1993. After seven issues it was forced to close, the first paper charged under a muzzling law introduced by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which had shot its way to power two years before. Three more of Eskinder’s newspapers were shut down by the courts. In 2012 he was sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of terrorism. He was released last year as part of an amnesty for political prisoners. 
Ethiopis is back in business, its return symbolising the start of a more hopeful era for press freedom. Hundreds of websites, blogs and satellite-TV channels have been unblocked since Abiy Ahmed took office as prime minister in April last year. For the first time in 13 years there are no journalists in prison; no fewer than 23 publications and six privately owned satellite channels have been given licences by the Ethiopian Broadcasting Authority since July. 
New provincial titles are emerging, too, including the first ever independent newspaper in Ethiopia’s troubled Somali region. Even state broadcasters are loosening up and giving airtime to opposition politicians. A new media bill is expected soon. It will probably soften criminal penalties for libel and lift some restrictions on private ownership that have crimped investment. 
This is not the first blossoming of free media. The EPRDF liberalised the press after it snatched power from a Marxist junta known as the Derg in 1991. More than 200 newspapers and 87 magazines were launched between 1992 and 1997. That did not last. Since 2001, 120 newspapers and 297 magazines received licences—but 261 of them were cancelled. At least 60 journalists fled the country between 2010 and 2015. 
Repression is one challenge for Ethiopia’s would-be press barons; a tough business environment is another. The average lifespan of an Ethiopian newspaper is nine months, reckons Endalk Chala, an academic who has studied the trade. Addis Zeybe, which was launched in October, stopped after only four issues. Advertisers “don’t want to be associated with media that is critical of the government”, says its founder, Abel Wabella. 
New titles face especially long odds. The state owns the main printing press, which can pulp issues the government does not like and which increased prices by almost 50% in December. “It’s a death blow,” says Eskinder. Abiy has spoken of the importance to democracy of a vibrant press, but state media still dominate, says Tsedale Lemma, the editor of Addis Standard, a feisty rag that recently returned from exile. 
Two tests of the new opening loom. The first is the willingness of state media to give equal time to the prime minister and his opponents in elections next year. Another will be the openness of Abiy himself to scrutiny: he has given only one press conference and few interviews. 
Eskinder recalls the aftermath of the election in 2005, when the EPRDF blamed newspapers for its failure to win a majority in Addis Ababa. “When this honeymoon ends I think we will have problems,” he says. Ominously, two local journalists reporting on controversial home demolitions near the capital were arrested last month. Upon release they were attacked by a mob outside the police station.
