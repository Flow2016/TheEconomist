###### A tale of two borders
# Why more undocumented migrants are reaching America 
##### Donald Trump’s habit of insulting Mexicans appears to have backfired

DONALD TRUMP promised to resort to untested measures to keep Mexican migrants from crossing America’s southern border. The promise contained at least two nagging flaws. The first is an outdated view. Migration of Mexicans is down by 90% from its peak in 2000; now most border-hoppers come from the “Northern Triangle” of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The second error was to rile Mexico with insults and threats when America relies on its goodwill to police its own southern border, which migrants must first cross before continuing on to America. 
In February the number of migrants stopped while trying to enter America from Mexico—a proxy for overall illegal migration levels—rose to 76,000. That is the highest number for any month in a decade. The increase consisted almost entirely of Central Americans, not Mexicans. Meanwhile, Mexican authorities have been deporting less than half as many Central Americans as usual since Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a left-winger, took office in December. Mexico deported one migrant for every four that were apprehended in America in the year before he took office. Now the ratio closer to one to ten. 
That is no coincidence. Mr López Obrador’s team vows to depart from the “mass deportations” of migrants that Mexico has carried out since 2014 at America’s behest. In January, confronted with a “caravan” of migrants from Honduras, Mexico handed out 13,000 wristbands, which doubled as a humanitarian visa, allowing migrants to stroll across into Mexico from Guatemala without fuss. Mexico plans to roll out a plan later this year allowing Central Americans to obtain humanitarian visas from Mexican consulates in their home countries. That will allow safer journeys. 
Mexico is not doing this purely to upset Mr Trump. It wants to reduce the $2.5bn that Mexican organised crime reaps from trafficking migrants each year. Olga Sánchez Cordero, Mexico’s secretary of the interior, recently told diplomats that “by history, tradition and conviction, Mexicans are a people in solidarity with those who arrive in our country.” Mr López Obrador believes that money is better spent tackling the causes of migration than on border security, and wants America to spend more to create jobs and strengthen the rule of law.

For a while, Mr Trump’s harsh rhetoric seemed to deter migrants. Border apprehensions dropped after his victory in November 2016, before any policies were implemented. For 18 months, many chose to delay the journey north. But that has not lasted. Mr Trump has little to show for his efforts to build a wall (let alone make Mexico pay for it), or to cut aid to Central American countries that fail to stop their citizens emigrating. Even his most hard-hearted policies, like caging children or removing gang and domestic violence as grounds for asylum, have not worked. 
For a sense of why this is so, look at Tapachula, a tropical town near Mexico’s border with Guatemala. Tales of gang threats and dead relatives abound. A farmer from Honduras complains of plunging coffee prices, reduced rainfall and insect plagues destroying his crops. Many migrants wait in the hot sun to apply for asylum. Mexico received nearly 8,000 requests in January and February, more than all the requests in 2013, 2014 and 2015 combined. 
Many migrants first enter Mexico via the nearby town of Ciudad Hidalgo. Just 200m away from a Mexican immigration office is a bustling river border. Guatemalans come and go on small rafts, for 7 quetzals ($0.90) a trip. Others use them to ferry loo paper and Coca-Cola across. Children bathe in the stream. Migrants tend to cross to Mexico at dawn, but they do not need to: law-enforcement officers are a rare sight. 
Even as Mexico applies a softer touch on its southern border, it is co-operating with America in its north. It is abiding by a new programme that requires migrants seeking asylum in America to wait in Mexico while their court date approaches. But diplomatic goodwill may fade if Central Americans keep streaming through Mexico “like water”, as Mr Trump tweeted last year. That seems likely, especially now that regular caravans offer migrants the chance to travel in the safety of a large group. 
Oddly, though, that may not drive Mr Trump to despair. Failing to reduce Central American migration may ultimately be more useful to him politically than succeeding ever could.
