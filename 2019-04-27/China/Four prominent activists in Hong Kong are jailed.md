PRO COMMUNIST Party newspapers in Hong Kong call them the “black hands”: the activists who inspired the “Umbrella Movement” of 2014 involving 79 days of sit-ins and demonstrations in busy commercial areas in support of democratic reform. On April 24th a court in Hong Kong sentenced eight of them, including four who were sent to jail. Two academics, Benny Tai (pictured) and Chan Kin-man, received the stiffest punishment: 16 months behind bars. A Baptist minister, Chu Yiu-Ming, was given the same sentence, but his term was suspended. Human-rights groups say the jailings will have a chilling effect on free speech. China would like that.
