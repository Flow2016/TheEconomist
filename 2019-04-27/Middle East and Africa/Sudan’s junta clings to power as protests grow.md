TO WALK AMONG the protesters in Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, is to be caught up in an intoxicating scene. Students, cheeks painted with Sudanese flags, march past, singing revolutionary songs. As their noise subsides so others rise: the rhymes of passing street poets, the speeches of firebrands atop makeshift stages. All around friends grab each other for selfies, recording for history (and Facebook) their role in ending three decades of dictatorship. They may call it a sit-in, but here nothing is still. 
It was the protesters’ sustained energy over several months that led to the ousting of Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s president since 1989, on April 11th. The next day they forced his successor, Awad Ibn Auf, to step down as well. Today the street is calling for the “third fall”, that of the ten-member Transitional Military Council (TMC), which is in charge of the country. “We have to keep applying the pressure,” says Abuzar Awad, a 31-year-old engineer. “Otherwise the military won’t give us our rights.” 
The military says it is willing to share power with a transitional government for an interim period, as a presidential election is prepared. But there is little doubt that it wants to maintain a hold on the country. For that reason the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a coalition of trade unions that spearheads the protests, suspended talks with the TMC on April 21st. “We want the military to protect the country, not rule the country,” said Ismail Eltag, a lawyer and spokesman for the SPA. 
The talks resumed on April 24th. A spokesman for the TMC said the two sides had reached an “agreement on most demands” and that, in a show of good faith, it would dismiss three generals who were close to Mr Bashir. A joint committee has been formed to try to bring order to the negotiations. But much was left vague, including whether any transitional government would answer to the generals. 
Unhelpfully, there is something of a political vacuum on the civilian side. The SPA has no single leader and has struggled to agree on who should be part of any new government. Meanwhile, other political groupings under the opposition umbrella group, the Alliance of Freedom and Change, are jostling for position. “Unless there is a clear plan the military will take over again,” warns Osman Mirghani, a newspaper editor. 
Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, the head of the TMC, and Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy head who goes by the nickname Hemedti, say the right things, but seem reluctant to cede authority. Hemedti, a militia commander whom many believe to be the most powerful member of the TMC, is “playing a game”, says a Western diplomat, by suggesting to the demonstrators that he is on their side, while hoping to take the top job. 
The junta has much to lose. An estimated 65%-70% of state spending goes on security, compared with just 5% for public health and education. Families connected to the military and security services run the businesses that dominate the Sudanese economy. Corruption is rife. 
Neighbouring powers are helping the TMC cling on. On April 21st Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) gave Sudan $3bn worth of aid, including $500m in cash deposited at the central bank—a lifeline in an inflationary economy short of hard currency. At a meeting in Cairo on April 23rd, members of the African Union, chaired this year by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt’s president (who himself took power in a coup), extended the bloc’s deadline for the TMC to give up power by three months. 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE see opportunities in Sudan’s upheaval. Mr Bashir’s National Congress Party grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that is loathed by the three countries. They now spy a chance to tear Sudan away from the Islamists of Turkey and Qatar, their regional rivals. The trio also wants to stamp out any hope of a new Arab spring. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are being “unhelpful”, says another diplomat. 
The “troika” of America, Britain and Norway is urging negotiations between the military and the protesters. It is also suggesting that the SPA reconsider some of its demands, such as having a civilian-led transitional government for four years (to allow the political scene to mature). 
The TMC may think it can buy time and grind down the protesters. But at the sit-in there is no sign of flagging spirits. If anything, the movement is growing. When a train from Atbara, more than 200 miles north, arrived in Khartoum on April 23rd, thousands of protesters greeted it. The carriages were as packed as those of a Tokyo subway train—but with more joyous passengers. On April 25th a “million-man march” was held in Khartoum, one of the largest gatherings yet. 
Sudanese youth are the vanguard of the protest movement, but this is not a juvenile revolt. Their parents are behind them. Abd Elazim Muhammad Kheir, a 65-year-old businessman, spent 21 years working at the Sudanese central bank. “All of the old regime are completely corrupt; if you’re not corrupt you cannot stay in office,” he says. “But the kids are not accepting it.” 
His 15-year-old son, Aamin, and 23-year-old daughter, Roan, have gone to the sit-in almost every day. Roan came back from Manchester, England, to join her peers. “I told them they will be killed, but they are willing to die for their country,” says Mr Kheir, with a mixture of fatherly pride and concern. Now he goes to the protests too. “To build a new society we have to sacrifice,” he says.
