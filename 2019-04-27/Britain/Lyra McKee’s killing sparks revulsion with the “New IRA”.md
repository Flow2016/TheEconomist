THE SHOT that killed Lyra McKee, one of Northern Ireland’s most promising young journalists, was fired by a youth urged on by embittered ancients still convinced that Irish republicanism can prevail only through the barrel of a gun. Leaders of the so-called New IRA, which has admitted responsibility, persuaded the unidentified killer that mainstream republicans had betrayed their followers by swapping violence for politics. Yet in provoking the murder, they have damaged their cause. 
The killing of Ms McKee, hit when rioting youths opened fire on police in Londonderry on April 18th, has caused shock waves. Her funeral in Belfast on April 24th was attended by the heads of the British and Irish governments, as well as Northern Irish political leaders, who made a rare show of unity after more than two years of bickering in which the region’s assembly has been suspended. Father Martin Magill, leading the service, received a standing ovation when he demanded of the politicians: “Why in God’s name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?” That she died on the eve of the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to three decades of sectarian Troubles in 1998, has only underlined what is at stake. 
No one expects a return to violence of the scale seen in the Troubles, whatever Brexit or any other development may bring. By the time it disbanded in 1998 the IRA had killed more than 1,700 people. Dissident republicans, who never accepted the peace, have since then killed fewer than 100. This is enough for the security services to rate their threat as “severe”. But the “micro-groups”, as Sinn Fein, the main republican party, dismisses them, lack the experience or skills to maintain an effective and sustained campaign. 
They are dangerous nonetheless. This has recently been illustrated twice in Derry, with Ms McKee’s killing and, in January, the detonation of a car bomb in a busy street following a warning of only 30 minutes. Dissident republicans also claimed responsibility for a number of parcel bombs posted to British addresses last month. The riot that Ms McKee was observing was sparked by police raids which gave troublemakers an excuse to blood young men in the arts of street warfare. 
So-called loyalist paramilitary groups represent a different sort of threat, still roaming the backstreets of Belfast but these days less interested in sectarian violence than everyday gangsterism. Since the end of the Troubles they have devoted themselves to lining their pockets through drug-dealing, loan-sharking and extortion in Protestant ghettoes. In January an east-Belfast man who had fallen foul of a loyalist organisation was murdered by a five-man gang who stabbed him in the back 11 times. 
Over the years the pattern has been that acts of terrorism which kill civilians cause widespread revulsion and lead to a dip in terrorist activity. Ms McKee’s killers have issued an apology, well aware that deaths like hers cost them public support. The Derry office of Saoradh, a political party supported by the New IRA, was smeared with red handprints by protesters. “Not in our name” was painted beneath a local republican mural. Police said that by the end of the Easter weekend over 140 people had offered information on the killing, a “sea change” in a city that has historically been reluctant to talk. Many Derry doors which were once opened to dissidents may now be shut in their faces.
