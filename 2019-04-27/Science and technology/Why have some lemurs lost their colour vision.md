# Why have some lemurs lost their colour vision? 
##### It helps them see better in the dark

PRIMATES’ TRICHROMATIC colour vision, with its red-, blue- and green-sensitive cone cells in the retina of the eye, is better than that of most mammals, which have to limp along dichromatically. It is thought to have evolved because primates are generally arboreal frugivores, and fruit are often brightly coloured. Some lemurs, however, are exceptions. They do indeed live in trees and consume fruit. But they have only two sorts of cone cell and are therefore unable to distinguish what other primates see as red and green, even though close relatives are trichromatic. That might be expected to make it hard to pick out red fruit, in particular, from a green, leafy background. 
The assumption until now has been that these lemurs have been unlucky and have lost part of their colour vision by chance at some point in the past. But Rachel Jacobs of George Washington University, in America, disagrees. A paper she has published in Behavioral Ecology and Sociology argues that these lemurs’ loss of the ability to see red, as it were, is no accident. 
Colour-blind lemurs all belong to the genus Eulemur, meaning they are closely related. That suggests they descend from a single individual, alive in the fairly recent evolutionary past, in which the pertinent mutation happened. To find out more, Dr Jacobs and her colleagues collected blood from 142 animals belonging to ten species of Eulemur and analysed the DNA of the cells therein to search for this mutation. 
Two of the ten, they found, had no relevant mutation, and presumably retained trichromatic vision. The others were, indeed, mutated in a way that made them dichromatic. But, to their surprise, not all in the same way. Seven of the eight shared one particular mutation. The other, Eulemur rubriventer, had a different one. Colour blindness has thus evolved twice in this group, meaning it is probably no accident. But if it is not an accident, then how does it help a lemur to have what is, on the face of things, a diminution of its visual capability? 
To find out, Dr Jacobs and her colleagues, who were already studying Eulemur rubriventer, spent eight months following nine troops of them through the Madagascan forest. They noted every item of food the animals consumed and used a spectrometer to measure the amount of light each food type reflected. 
The result of this arduous travail was the discovery that Eulemur rubriventer is indeed adept at finding red fruit. The crucial point was that unlike their primate cousins, monkeys and apes, which are mainly diurnal, lemurs come out at night. The advantage of trichromy disappears in darkness, when colours are hard to distinguish. But the spectrometer data showed that fruit still stand out against a leafy background because they reflect more light than leaves do, and therefore look brighter. 
These observations suggest that colour vision ceases to be an advantage at night. But Dr Jacobs goes further. She proposes that full colour vision might actually hinder the animals’ night sight, by interfering with perceptions of brightness. This will require further testing. But, if true, it would be enough for evolution to reverse itself and favour the dichromatic mutations that members of Eulemer now sport.
