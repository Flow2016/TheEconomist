# The re-election of Indonesia’s president has exposed a widening rift 
##### Indonesian society appears divided along religious lines

DURING THE evening of April 17th, only a few hours after polling stations had closed, Prabowo Subianto, one of the two candidates in Indonesia’s presidential election, declared himself the winner. His rival, Joko Widodo, the incumbent president, who is usually known as Jokowi, was more cautious: he told his supporters to wait patiently for the final count. But as both men surely knew, despite Mr Prabowo’s bluster, Jokowi had the election in the bag. 
Official results will not be announced until May, but early estimates known as “quick counts”, based on samples of actual returns, are usually accurate to within a percentage point or so. Most show that Jokowi was the clear winner, with about 55% of the vote. Mr Prabowo’s claim that he won 62% is implausible, but he insists he will press his case in the constitutional court. 
The same thing happened in the previous presidential race, in 2014, which featured the same candidates. Mr Prabowo claimed to have won, even though the official results showed Jokowi to be the victor, by 53% to 47%. The constitutional court dismissed Mr Prabowo’s objections on that occasion and is likely to do so again. 
Voters also elected a national parliament, as well as provincial, city and district assemblies. For now only estimates of the parliamentary results are available. They show that Jokowi’s party, PDI-P, remains the biggest, but did not make the gains he had hoped. The new legislature will look much like the old one, with Jokowi’s ruling coalition keeping its majority. 
Jokowi seems to have improved his showing marginally by picking Ma’ruf Amin, a Muslim cleric, as his running-mate. Mr Ma’ruf is the former head of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), a largely moderate Muslim organisation which claims 50m members. Exit polls suggest that more NU members voted for Jokowi than when he was first elected. That presumably explains how he extended his lead in East and Central Java, two populous provinces where NU has lots of members. 
In most provinces, in fact, the winning candidate extended his lead, suggesting that voters are more polarised than they were in 2014. The ten provinces where Jokowi performed best are all ones he won in 2014. Among them, he increased his margin by ten percentage points on average. Likewise, seven of Mr Prabowo’s top ten provinces this time around were ones he also won in 2014. His lead in those places rose by 14 percentage points, on average. 
Worse, in a country with a history of faith-based violence, these divisions appear to fall mainly along religious and ethnic lines. Jokowi gained votes in areas where most people are not Muslim, such as Papua and Bali, and in parts of Java where moderate Islam is practised. By contrast, Mr Prabowo did best in places with more doctrinaire Muslims, such as Aceh and nearby West Sumatra. 
Both sides are to blame for the polarisation, says Aaron Connelly of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank. Mr Prabowo has pandered to hardline Islamists who make people of other religions or different strains of Islam feel nervous. But even as Jokowi has made a show of piety, he has banned one hardline Islamist group and allowed prosecutors to bring charges against the leader of another, enabling the Islamists to paint themselves as persecuted. 
Term-limits mean that Jokowi’s second five years in office will be his last. He has promised to continue working on the main themes of his first term by building more infrastructure and rolling out more anti-poverty measures, with a special focus on training and education. Freed from the need to watch the polls, he might try to push through more controversial reforms or even attempt to promote tolerance and pluralism. 
But there are reasons to suspect that the schisms in Indonesian society will deepen. One is that the NU is well placed to demand concessions: its former head is the vice-president; its political arm increased its share of the vote in the legislative election; and the organisation was instrumental in securing votes for Jokowi in Java. As well as extracting more money from the budget for their heartland, NU’s leaders are likely to lobby Jokowi to make life difficult for more conservative Islamic groups, which largely supported Mr Prabowo and which NU sees as a threat. 
Moreover, the opposition has become more willing to take to the streets. In 2016 demonstrations led by hardline Islamist groups helped bring down the governor of Jakarta, an ally of Jokowi, and have been repeated since. Experts reckon that Mr Prabowo can now bring about 1m people to the streets of the capital with relative ease if he wants to object to a new policy. Some suspect he will try to bolster his claim to have won the election in this way. 
The first big demonstrations of this sort prompted Jokowi’s crackdown on extreme Islamists. The spiral of recrimination is not yet over, it seems.
