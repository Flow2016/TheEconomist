# Campaigning against the North Korean regime is a thankless task 
##### Kim Jong Un’s opponents are underfunded and largely unsuccessful

ONE AFTERNOON in February a man knocked on the door of the North Korean embassy in Madrid and asked to speak to the chargé d’affaires. Having been invited in, he opened the door to his nine accomplices. According to the Spanish judge investigating the incident, the group proceeded to beat, tie up and interrogate those inside. When the police came knocking hours later, alerted by neighbours who had heard the screams of a woman who had managed to escape through a window, a man who looked like a North Korean official opened the door and told them that everything was in order. Shortly afterwards, the assailants fled the scene in two cars belonging to the embassy and an Uber, carrying stolen pen drives, computers and hard drives. They escaped to Portugal, and eventually to America, where they allegedly presented their loot to the FBI. 
The raid, which might have been lifted from the pages of a spy thriller, was the first direct assault on a North Korean diplomatic mission in the country’s 70-year existence. It failed in what appeared to be its main aim, to convince the diplomats in the embassy to defect. It is unclear whether it did any damage to the North Korean regime. But the incident has cast a rare spotlight on the activities of the opponents of North Korea’s despot. 
The group which has claimed responsibility for the stunt in Madrid, a relatively new outfit known as Cheollima Civil Defence, after a mythical winged horse, or Free Joseon, for Korea’s last imperial dynasty, professes unusually ambitious plans. On March 1st, the anniversary of a Korean uprising against Japanese colonialism, it declared on its website that it had established a “provisional government,” the “sole legitimate representative of the Korean people of the north”. 
After a Spanish court issued extradition warrants for two of the alleged participants in the raid on the embassy, Cheollima Civil Defence published another statement denying that it had used violence. America subsequently arrested one of the wanted men and raided the apartment of the other. One is a former marine, the other an activist against the North Korean regime for over a decade. Both live in America, and are of Korean descent. 
Cheollima Civil Defence has accused the Spanish and American governments of siding with the North Korean regime, suggesting its members had hoped to remain anonymous and have had to go into hiding since their identities were revealed. They are certainly right to be worried. There is no open dissent against the regime within North Korea, where the reward for engaging in any semblance of political protest is the gulag or the firing squad. Even outside the country, dissidents are not necessarily safe from the North’s assassins. But some remain undeterred. In the South, escapee activists have for years been engaged in a form of information warfare against the North. They launch balloons carrying anti-regime messages, South Korean soap operas and money across the border. They hope to persuade their fellow citizens to resist or flee the country. 
It is a thankless task. The South’s government provides some funding and protection for high-profile dissidents. But it also discourages their activities. Past administrations were concerned about the risk of military escalation along the border (North Korea has on occasion opened fire on balloons). The current one also worries about putting its ongoing rapprochement with the North at risk. Some element of competition with the dissidents may be at work, too. After all, the South Korean government also claims to be the legitimate representative of the North Korean people. A quiet building at the foot of Bukhansan mountain in northern Seoul houses the offices of the South’s governors for the five provinces that make up North Korea. 
The furore in Madrid has given the dissidents a welcome boost. Park Sang-hak, a defector who represents an association of several dozen such groups, is so much in demand that he insists on being interviewed in his car, while his driver takes on Seoul’s traffic at breakneck speed. “Our aim is to overthrow the Kim regime and free the North Korean people,” says Mr Park, who fled North Korea nearly 20 years ago. He claims the groups he represents have up to 800 members between them. On April 14th Mr Park’s group launched 20 balloons carrying 500,000 leaflets across the border from a town north of Seoul. Earlier this month, it staged a protest outside the embassy in Madrid in solidarity with the wanted assailants. 
Mr Park claims to have associates in the North, and some of his fellow activists say they would join armed resistance against the regime if a rebellion were launched from within. But for now, the most effective resistance against the North’s regime may be the existence of the democratic, prosperous country in which he lives.
