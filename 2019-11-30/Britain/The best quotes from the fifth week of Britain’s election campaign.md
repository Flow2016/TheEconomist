Stoked tensions“My house is a fortress, my office is a fortress. I’ve got panic buttons in my house, I carry one in my pocket.”Ruth Smeeth, a Labour mp, on the impact of anti-Semitism. Stoke Sentinel 
 Voting up a storm“There were millions of people who thought their ‘one little vote’ didn’t mean shit, and now Trump is the president of America and we are leaving the EU. So your vote really does count.”Stormzy, a rapper, urges his fans to register ahead of the November 26th deadline 
Are you local?“As you know, only the Scottish National Party can beat the Tories here in East Dunbartonshire.”John Nicolson, an snp candidate, forgets during a hustings that he is in fact standing in Ochil and South Perthshire
