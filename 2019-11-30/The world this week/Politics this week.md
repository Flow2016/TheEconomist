Opposition candidates won a stunning victory in Hong Kong’s local elections, a result that activists claimed as an endorsement of protesters’ demands for full democracy. A record turnout saw 3m voters go to the polls. Carrie Lam, the territory’s beleaguered leader, promised to “seriously reflect” on the outcome. China warned America of “firm counter-measures” in response to Donald Trump’s signing of two bills showing support for democracy in Hong Kong. See article. 
China has 276 embassies and other diplomatic offices, more than any other country, according to the Lowy Institute, a think-tank. It passed America, which has 273, this year. France, Japan and Russia took the next three spots on the list. 
The BJP chief minister of Maharashtra, India’s second- most-populous state, resigned after holding office for just three days, when the supreme court said he must face a vote of confidence. He had, in effect, been installed in the job by the national BJP-led government in Delhi following a contentious election in October and political shenanigans to form a coalition. See article. 
Trade unions and student groups have led large protests and two national strikes in Colombia. Their complaints include proposals by the government to raise the pension age and the slow implementation of a peace deal with the FARC guerrilla group. A student was killed by a tear-gas canister, increasing the anger. 
Luis Lacalle Pou, a candidate of the centre-right, apparently won Uruguay’s presidential election. His narrow victory, if confirmed by the country’s electoral court, will end 15 years of rule by the centre-left Broad Front coalition. Mr Lacalle Pou has promised to fight crime and slash the government’s large deficit. 
Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, expressed concerns about what a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn might mean for Jewish people. He said the party’s claim that it had investigated every allegation of anti-Semitism among its members was a “mendacious fiction”. In a TV interview Mr Corbyn repeatedly failed to apologise for his failure to deal with the problem. See article. 
Britain’s political parties published their manifestos for the forthcoming election. Labour promised an additional £83bn ($107bn) of day-to-day spending by 2024 (around 4% of GDP). The Liberal Democrats would have a surplus, despite splashing out more than £50bn a year. The Tories were the stingiest, promising just an additional £3bn. All parties would take government spending to over 40% of GDP, reversing a decade-long trend of shrinking the state. See article. 
Malta was rocked by a spate of high-level resignations, two years after the murder of a journalist who had been investigating corruption on the island. The tourism and economy ministers stood down. The prime minister’s chief of staff was arrested. See article. 
The European Parliament voted to confirm the new European Commission, which will now take office under its president, Ursula von der Leyen. Britain declined to nominate a commissioner, but the process moved ahead anyway. See article. 
Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, faced a challenge to his leadership after being charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases. Mr Netanyahu called the indictment an “attempted coup”. But Gideon Saar, a high-ranking member of Mr Netanyahu’s own Likud party, said the prime minister should go. See article. 
The authorities in Egypt raided the offices of Mada Masr, the last big independent media voice in the country. Since taking power in a coup in 2013, President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has cracked down on dissent and free speech. Mada Masr, an online publication, had recently published an article criticising Mr Sisi’s son, who is a senior intelligence official. See article. 
Several people, including health workers combating the Ebola virus, were killed in protests in the Democratic Republic of Congo amid rising public anger directed at the UN’S peacekeeping mission over its inability to protect civilians from Islamist rebels. Their latest attack killed at least 19 people. 
Tanzania’s ruling party won 99% of the seats it contested in local elections that were boycotted by the opposition, which accused the government of manipulation. The local poll is a worrying prelude to national elections next year. The government has locked up members of the opposition and journalists. 
A collision between two helicopters in Mali killed 13 French troops fighting jihadists in the Sahel. The incident was the single biggest loss of life suffered by the French armed forces since the 1980s. 
Michael Bloomberg belatedly entered the race to be the Democrats’ presidential candidate, joining a contest that has been hostile to billionaires. He spent $31m on TV ads in just one week, a record. Although Mr Bloomberg has toyed with running for president before, this is his first official campaign. He is pursuing a risky strategy, not campaigning in the early primary states in order to focus on delegate-rich Super Tuesday in March. See article. 
The Trump administration ousted the secretary of the navy, Richard Spencer, in a row over a navy SEAL who had been convicted of taking a picture next to a dead jihadist in Iraq and threatened with expulsion from the service. Ostensibly, Mr Spencer was fired for not telling Mark Esper, the defence secretary, about his dealings with the White House. But the top brass are furious with Donald Trump for reinstating the disgraced SEAL’s rank. See article. 
A federal judge ruled that senior advisers to Mr Trump must comply with subpoenas issued by committees conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president, and ordered Don McGahn, a former White House counsel, to testify to Congress. “Presidents are not kings,” said the judge. The administration is to appeal against the ruling. See article.
