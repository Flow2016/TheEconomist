The advice you gave to make companies more diverse did not mention people with disabilities, even once (“Diversity memo”, November 9th). As Diversish, a satirical campaign, puts it, “If disability is not on your agenda, neither is diversity.” Research shows that hiring people with disabilities confers the same kinds of benefits mentioned in your article: increased creativity and innovation, improved productivity, decreased staff turnover and improved job satisfaction. A report by Accenture in 2018 looked at 45 American firms that employed the disabled and found that they had higher revenues and profit margins and outperformed their peers in terms of shareholder returns. 
Globally, one in seven people has a disability. Yet the employment rate for people with disabilities is only half of that for people without disabilities, and the gap is widening. Disability is seldom discussed in boardrooms and executives rarely or never discuss it in their workplace.

For a “Hard-headed guide to diversity”, you had very little to say on what targets are needed, or why. The supposed benefits to companies or the reduced groupthink are, as you admit, unconfirmed hypotheses. And you did not consider whether the skills and attitudes that businesses need are equally common in all target groups.

In “The lap of luxury” (November 9th), Les Standiford attributed the rise of Palm Beach to the Florida East Coast Railway line, built at the start of the 20th century. Palm Beach’s beginnings go back a little further. Palms are not endemic to that part of America, but in January 1878, a 150-tonne Spanish brig, the Providencia, carrying a cargo of coconuts from the Caribbean to Spain, foundered soon after leaving Cuba. It finally ran aground on the Florida coast, spilling its cargo along the beach. Local residents feasted off the nuts, and then planted the hundreds that were left over, giving the area its palms and its name.

America’s military is in many ways a self-licking ice-cream cone, and this exacerbates the problem of political accountability (Lexington, November 9th). It serves functions separate from whether it wins or loses wars, or whether there is any clear mission in the first place. Many see the armed forces as part of the social safety net, providing recruits with a sense of belonging, discipline and educational opportunities. Veterans serve as mascots for citizens, politicians and sometimes themselves, in order to validate the national civic culture and patriotism. Group identities require myths, myths require epic struggles and heroes. 
A war’s legitimacy and efficacy matter comparatively little. The marine corps’ birthday message, promulgated by top brass in 2015, was: “You fight for the corps first…God may come second. Country can come third.” How do you hold that kind of institutional self-idolisation accountable to any external criteria? Voter apathy is only part of the puzzle.

One way to re-establish citizens’ links to the armed forces would be to require national service for all residents in the age range of the previous draft. This would apply to both sexes and could be in either the army or civilian service. The latter might involve programmes like Volunteers for America, the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and so on, as well as ideally, a reincarnation of the Civilian Conservation Corps from the 1930s. That programme made a significant impact on alleviating unemployment during the Depression and completed many infrastructure projects.

In his column on computer-generated writing, Johnson took a jab at a favourite punch bag: post-modern academics in the humanities, and how they were fooled into accepting handwritten bogus papers in their journals (November 2nd). However, Nature reported in February 2014 how publishers had to withdraw “more than 120 gibberish papers” in the sciences. “Computer-generated papers” apparently found their way into 30 published conference proceedings between 2008 and 2013. Sixteen appeared in publications from Springer and more than 100 were published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The works were generated by SCIgen, a computer program that three students at MIT created to generate fake computer-science papers. 
As a computer scientist, I take a certain perverse pride that computers can clearly do a better job at generating bogus research papers than humans. 
ERIC HAINESSomerville, Massachusetts 
Johnson claimed that artificial intelligence can’t emulate creativity. This hasn’t been my experience. I have used OpenAI’s GPT-2 to interview hundreds of fake humans. Each “human” has something important to say about their unlived lives. True, these interviews had some human input; I edited and curated the content myself. But this isn’t much different from how literature is delivered now. AI text generators produce a lot of meaningless dross, but so too do humans. In both cases we rely on humans to curate the prose that is worth reading. Artificial writers will occasionally say something poetic or insightful, and are worth reading even if they didn’t emerge from a human brain.

A meaty issue* I was dismayed to see your Daily chart on “How much would giving up meat help the environment?” (November 15th). The axes were distorted (from log to linear), and you removed a most concerning datapoint, for sugar-sweetened beverages, from the original that called the paper it referenced into question. The result was that the original figure’s message was distorted to more conveniently serve your headline. This is important, because the environmental impact of health-care use is significant (10% of greenhouse gases in the United States), and food choices that increase health-care use, such as sugary beverages, would mitigate any emissions savings from moving away from unprocessed foods, including meat. The health impact data that the original paper is based on has been largely called into question following the publication of the NutriRECS papers on October 1st. Finally, you did not question the original paper’s use of relative risk measures, versus absolute risk. Relative risk magnifies perceived harms and is often used when the actual increased risk of a behaviour is not as great.I describe the changes in this graphic. I’d also like to point out that your chart discussion implies that dietary choices are the major determinant of personal emissions. They are not. Transportation and fossil fuel use are far more significant. To support this fact, another study has shown that the elimination of all animal agriculture from the United States would reduce greenhouse gases by 2.6 %, with the resulting widespread malnutrition.DR TED EYTANWashington, DC 
Emmanuel Macron labelled Bosnia as Europe’s ticking time-bomb (“Emmanuel Macron in his own words”, November 7th). That is inflammatory, unfounded and hypocritical. Mr Macron forgets that France is the largest single source of European fighters in Iraq and Syria. Although there are Bosnians who have unfortunately made the same decision to fight, Bosnia has imprisoned the returning fighters. Mr Macron was behind the recent decision at the European Union to block membership talks with Albania and North Macedonia. His statements about Bosnia and the Balkans in general will only serve to increase disillusionment about the EU among the Balkan countries, and in turn further embolden bad actors in the region and other powers vying for influence, such as Russia, China and Turkey. 
The Balkans may well be a problem on the EU’s doorstep, but not for the reasons Mr Macron highlights.

Europe “is on the edge of a precipice,” says Mr Macron. In the 1960s the leader of then-communist Poland, Wladyslaw Gomulka, proudly announced on television that “A year ago we were on the edge of a precipice. Since then, we have made a great leap forward.”
