Licence to be Bad: How Economics Corrupted Us. By Jonathan Aldred.Allen Lane; 320 pages; £25. 
IN THOMAS GRADGRIND, Charles Dickens created an educator who saw his pupils as “reasoning animals”, with heads that should be filled with facts and little more. In “Licence to be Bad”, Jonathan Aldred, an academic at Cambridge University, casts economists as the modern Gradgrinds. They exercise a baleful influence on political discourse, he maintains, by taking a narrow view of humans as essentially selfish creatures, forever trying to maximise their own well-being. 
As Mr Aldred points out, economists have not always thought this way. Adam Smith is a hero of free-market enthusiasts but, as well as “The Wealth of Nations”, he wrote “The Theory of Moral Sentiments”, in which he opined: “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness necessary to him.” In the 20th century John Maynard Keynes wrote that “economics is essentially a moral science and not a natural science. That is to say, it employs introspection and judgments of value.” 
But modern economics, the author argues, dismisses ethics in favour of a narrow focus on self-interest. “The argument that both parties to a voluntary transaction must be better off, otherwise it wouldn’t take place,” he writes, “is used to wash away all considerations of justice, fairness, responsibility, exploitation and so on.” 
Mr Aldred says that economists have constructed an idealised version of the world in which people deal with each other on equal terms, so government intervention is unnecessary, indeed positively harmful. They have applied the same reasoning in the law courts, leading to the doctrine that bargaining by parties achieves the optimal outcome. 
A particular target of Mr Aldred’s ire is the late Gary Becker, who won the Nobel prize in 1992 for his economic analysis of social issues. Becker argued that discrimination against women or ethnic minorities costs the discriminator money; in fully competitive markets, it would be competed away. This argument has been used by some to claim that anti-discrimination laws can be repealed, as they are unnecessary. It is certainly true that Becker can come across as laughably po-faced. Mr Aldred quotes his definition of love: “It can be said that M{-1} loves F{-1} if her welfare enters his utility function.” 
The idea that all human actions can be reduced to a calculation of self-interest is a bleak one. And it is not true. In Britain, for example, people give blood out of a sense of civic duty. Studies show that blood donation declines when rewarded by money; worse still, money induces donors to withhold details of medical conditions. In a Swiss village, support for siting a nuclear-waste dump nearby fell when the residents were offered compensation; they did not like the idea of being bribed. 
The author neatly subverts the cynicism of some economists, such as the public-choice school which believes that politicians and officials are more interested in advancing their own interests than in the public good. By the same logic, he says, public-choice economists may be advancing their theories simply to boost their academic careers and their chances of a lucrative book contract. 
But it is unfair to tar all economists with the same brush; Becker’s views came in for lots of criticism from within the profession, for instance. On the left, Thomas Piketty, Joseph Stiglitz and Tony Atkinson have all worried about inequality; Mariana Mazzucato has pointed to the crucial role played by governments in long-term investment. And Mr Aldred is strangely dismissive of behavioural economists, who accept that humans are not desiccated calculating machines, and—in the hope of encouraging people to pay their taxes, or to save for their old age—tweak their recommendations accordingly. “Licence to be Bad” is a powerful tirade, but it is too sweeping in its condemnations. ◼
