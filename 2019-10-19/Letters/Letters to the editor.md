The gist of your briefing on Europe’s single market was that if the EU further liberalises cross-border exchange, it will achieve dynamism “much like America, with nothing to impede the free movement of goods, services, people and capital” (“An unconscious coupling”, September 14th). This underestimates the barriers to business across American states. Consider these examples. Europe has unified goods standards; American states often have their own. Europe has mutual recognition of most professions; American states have nothing of the sort. Europe strives to liberalise public procurement; American states can ban out-of-state providers entirely. You mentioned the impediments in Denmark to foreign ownership of law firms. Similar rules are pervasive among American states. 
Overall, the American economy enjoys high mobility and cross-border exchange (and the concomitant economic benefits) despite fragmented regulation and much outright protectionism. Europe still has worthwhile work to do, but overall it has lower mobility and exchange despite far greater efforts to eliminate interstate barriers. A “single-market project” might deliver more economic benefits in America than in Europe.

Your article on transgender pupils in British schools reports on new guidance, which suggests that if “a girl feels uncomfortable that a male child who identifies as a girl is using the girls’ changing room…the girl who feels awkward, not the trans child, should go and change elsewhere” (“A new gender agenda”, October 5th). You seem to think this is a bad thing. Yet feeling “awkward” is mild compared with the alternative: the trans girl being separated into her own changing room or into the boys’ room. The reasons why young trans people often suffer from mental-health issues is not because they are trans, but because they experience high levels of stigma, discrimination, social exclusion, family rejection, bullying, harassment and assaults.

The Labour Party’s motion to abolish Eton, Britain’s top private school, is perhaps understandable (“A row going on down near Slough”, September 28th). Still, it is important to remember that Eton counts among its graduates not only David Cameron and Boris Johnson, but also George Orwell and John Maynard Keynes. In the wider picture, expropriation and democratic division never work in the long term. Instead of contemplating the demise of private schools, Labour could work on a much more relevant task: raising the standard of education in state schools. 
Britain did not fare well in the OECD’s PISA evaluations from 2015, reaching 22nd in the average score for reading literacy and 27th in mathematics. In December this year the new PISA reports will be released; we will know then if there has been any improvement. However, Labour’s election manifesto might have already been written by that time.

As you said, one inherent characteristic of the Internet of Things is the scale of it (Technology Quarterly, September 14th). The conundrum is that these billions of devices will be based on fast-moving technology that expires within years, rather than the decades of today’s fridges and microwaves. This will have an environmental effect, as there will be a higher turnover of discarded appliances. Little attention is given to efficiencies. As a professor and director of an IoT spin-off, I continually remind my students and our developers of this trap. Ethics and environmental awareness must be part of the smart-engineering curriculum. 
Moreover, although the IoT does provide an opportunity to reduce the environmental footprint of air conditioning, a much bigger problem is water heating, which accounts for a larger share of household energy use. The optimised control of water heating, which is simple with the data-mining of hot-water use, can save up to a third of that energy.

The claim that there is an “analogy” between the Internet of Things and electricity, “another world-changing innovation”, is off the mark. If, for some reason, I want to separate myself from electricity, all I have to do is flip the switch, or pull the plug, or, if I was really serious, chop the cables altogether. That is harder with the IoT. It will track me, my actions and my thoughts no matter what I want or do, all the way to my grave and likely beyond if some government decides that it would be helpful to monitor the decomposition of bodies for some social or environmental purpose. 
Hence, no “analogy”. Instead, an altogether new culture and civilisation.

You listed a number of instances where evoking the will of the people “marks the user out not as a democrat but as a scoundrel” (“Down with the people”, October 5th). But there was no mention of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum on Brexit, or the People’s Assembly. This has been proposed by the Greens and based around committees, supposedly to show that the public agrees with them on everything (unless they don’t, in which case the participants would undoubtedly be changed).

A notion of “the people”, or Volk, was the driving force of modern German nationalism, an ethnic vision that laid the foundation for the sickening justifications of Nazi eugenics. The idea has never gone away. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) readopted the term Volk despite its Nazi overtones and won 13% of the vote at the 2017 German election.

Bagehot’s comparison of Boris Johnson to Richard Nixon was a bit far-fetched (October 5th). Nixon had a modest upbringing as the son of a humble grocer, rather like Margaret Thatcher. He rose to the top through hard work and sustained a sense of resentment and mistrust towards the east- coast elite. 
Mr Johnson represents the British equivalent of the very elite whom Nixon resented. The British prime minister’s rise to the top was fuelled by a mixture of Etonian charm, social connections, pathological dishonesty and disloyalty.

I know The Economist has moved to new modern offices, but I did not know they were sufficiently liberal as to allow Bartleby to keep a “pot plant” at his desk (September 28th). Perhaps he would prefer hot boxes to hot desks.
