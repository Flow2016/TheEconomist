WHEN PEOPLE are about to die, Sir Don McCullin observes, “they often look up”, searching for “one last chance that maybe somebody can save [them].” Condemned prisoners glance skyward in Goya’s paintings, he notes, as did some of the doomed souls he encountered on his assignments, such as in the killing fields of Lebanon in 1976. In the pictures from Beirut that appear in a new exhibition of Sir Don’s work at Tate Britain in London, a woman wails for her murdered family. Gunmen crouch in a ruined ballroom. 
Sometimes, rather than turning to the heavens, the victims looked to Sir Don for salvation instead. He remembers in particular a starving boy in Biafra, crawling across a muddy playground, covered in flies. Often his subjects stare into his lens: an exhausted mother in a Bangladeshi refugee camp; a Zambian AIDS orphan; a woman arrested at a protest in England against the bomb. They looked, but “all I’ve got around my neck is two Nikon cameras.” He was doing a job, but you can’t “hide behind the camera”. 
Sir Don couldn’t hide, and neither can his viewers. Looking at him, his subjects seem also to be gazing through and beyond his black-and-white images. What, he asks, could he say to that starving boy? His work is an accusation—against the perpetrators of the cruelty he intimately chronicled, against his audience and against himself. 
“My whole life has been built upon violence,” Sir Don reflects. Born in London in 1935, he was evacuated to Lancashire during the war, billeted in a “hell-hole” with a bullying farmer. He took his first published photo in the aftermath of a deadly street fight; it shows a gang from Finsbury Park, his rough London neighbourhood, peering from the carcass of a bombed-out building. When the Observer ran it in 1959, the biggest thrill was seeing his father’s surname in print: the older McCullin had died when Don was 13, which was when he gave up on God. Around that time, some policemen asked him where he got his camera (“they were always smacking you around”). More worried about what his mother might do to the bobbies than what they might do to him, he kept them away from the house while he fetched the receipt. “The old lady was quite ferocious really.” 
He began to learn his craft during national service in Egypt and Kenya, where he was deployed in a unit that processed aerial reconnaissance. He took himself to Berlin when the wall was being built in 1961, snapping American troops at Checkpoint Charlie (see picture below). Then he went to war, largely for the Sunday Times.

Finsbury Park, it turned out, was “child’s play”. “I’ve been with all kinds of murderers in my life,” Sir Don says; “men killing people in front of me, just because they like killing people.” Soon he eschewed the “flags and bugles and Napoleonic stuff”, focusing instead on civilians, who always suffered most. As in his shot of a besuited young Catholic, taking on British troops in Londonderry with a stick in 1971 (see top picture), in his images of conflict there is often a sense of life interrupted. Bystanders peek from doorways. Relatives mourn. 
It was a dangerous trade. In 1970 his camera took a bullet for him as he zigzagged through a Cambodian paddy field; a week later he was wounded by a mortar, crawling away to evade the Khmer Rouges. (“Did I do this?” he asks in momentary wonderment.) In 1972 he spent four days in a Ugandan prison, where every morning Idi Amin’s lorries would take corpses to the Nile to feed to the crocodiles: “I thought I’d had it.” Charles Glass, a foreign correspondent and friend, says Sir Don “will endure any amount of discomfort and suffering to get a picture.” He complained, Mr Glass says, only when pettifogging officials barred the path to his destination. 
Some wounds didn’t heal. Feeling “more elated and more blessed” for surviving, he sensed he was becoming a war junkie. “Every two or three years,” he recalls, “I’d have a kind of breakdown.” Now, at 83, stories tumble out of him, like the one about a man with a blown-off face he took to hospital in Salvador in 1982, whose “eyes were screaming”. Or about the company of marines he saw “chewed up” in Hue. “I think about it every bloody day,” he says. “My head is overcrowded with memory.” 
He blames politicians: “90% of the things I went and photographed was because they bollocksed up.” That goes equally for the struggling English towns that he documented between foreign jobs. His close-up portrait of a homeless Irishman in London’s East End, wild hair framing a haunted visage, is as wrenching in its way as his battlefields. Cities are “where the real truth is,” he reckons. Even his glowering English landscapes seem suffused with threat. For him, the Roman ruins he photographed in North Africa are imbued with the hardship of the slaves who built them. 
So his output was always political but, he insists, “it never was art…It’s not me.” His resistance to that label stems partly from his background (“I never went to school very much”), and partly from a sense of guilt, even self-disgust. To convey the “stench and the smell of war”, he had to “connive to bring [viewers] in and hold them”, with a compositional skill that transmutes anguish into a chilling beauty. As a result, many of the photos he took for newspapers have come to seem as much archetypal as records of specific events; an existential inquiry into innocence and evil, suffering and endurance, as much as journalism. Their subjects seem both frozen in a dead past and admonishingly alive. 
Sir Don invests as much effort in making the pictures as he did in taking them, constantly revisiting old negatives to refine his images. He made all the silver-gelatin prints in the Tate’s show himself. Simon Baker, one of the curators, says he has a “very curious, unusual feeling of obligation” to his material, which Mr Baker sees as a way of “paying respect to the subject”. Sir Don still does long, therapeutic stints in his dark room in Somerset, which he likens to being “alone in your mother’s womb”. 
For all that devotion, he doubts that he has made any difference: “Looking back, it served no purpose, my life.” He has “been preaching to the converted”, he concludes, as he surveys, say, the depredations of Islamic State. “I just don’t trust humanity.” Then he mentions how, that morning, he passed up a chance to take “the greatest photo in the world”. On a London street he saw a businessman drinking his coffee and squinting at his phone, while on the pavement beside him a homeless man huddled in a sleeping bag. But Sir Don didn’t have his camera. “I felt naked.”
