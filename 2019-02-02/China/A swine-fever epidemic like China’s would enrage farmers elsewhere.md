# A swine-fever epidemic like China’s would enrage farmers elsewhere 
##### Millions of Chinese pig-rearers face ruin, in silence

UNTIL NOW links between social-realist cinema and “Peppa Pig”, a sweet British-made animated television series for children, have been hard to spot. Then came “What is Peppa?”, a beautifully crafted film about China’s rural-urban divide, family ties and the sadness of old age that has accumulated hundreds of millions of online views over the past few days. 
Officially, the six-minute short is an advertising trailer for a children’s feature film made for the China market, “Peppa Pig Celebrates Chinese New Year”. It is timed to cash in on the festival: day one of a pig-year in the Chinese zodiac falls on February 5th. Yet many grown-ups felt a pang of recognition as they watched the trailer’s bittersweet, live-action depiction of Li Yubao, a gruff-but-loving Chinese villager striving to please his city-dwelling grandson, notably by puzzling out the toddler’s request for a Peppa-themed gift. Filmed in the village of Waijinggou, in the dusty, hardscrabble hills that encircle northern Beijing, the short film is rather honest about modern inequalities. The mystery of Peppa’s identity is solved by a village woman who worked in Beijing as a nanny. When grandfather and toddler meet, the child’s eyes show fear at this wild-haired, over-loud old man, as well as excitement. 
Still, the film leaves a lot out. A true work of social realism, if set in a farming village in February 2019, would acknowledge a reality that Chinese officials and state media are trying to downplay. Rural China is in the grip of a long-feared catastrophe, an epidemic of African Swine Fever (ASF). China’s first case was confirmed on August 3rd 2018. It could ruin millions of pig-rearing smallholders in places just like Waijinggou. As of January 25th the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a UN agency, had confirmed 104 outbreaks of ASF in China and the culling of 916,000 pigs. Though the disease poses no threat to humans, there is no cure for infected swine and no vaccine against it. Vincent Martin, the agency’s envoy to China, says eradication “may not be feasible in the short term”, especially if wild pigs act as a reservoir for the virus. Russia offers ominous clues to the future. There an 11-year fight to control ASF has caused backyard pork production to fall by almost half, while large commercial farms which can afford strict biosecurity controls actually increased production. Such a shift would transform rural China, where almost half a billion pigs are produced each year, about 40% of them on small farms with fewer than 30 sows. 
Transparency is a work in progress. Just a dozen years ago Chinese government vets talking to foreign colleagues sometimes refused to speak the names of illnesses aloud, coyly lamenting the arrival of “disease X” in “province Y”. Today China tells the UN about outbreaks and quarantine zones in which the transport of live pigs is banned and markets are closed. It has announced new bans on feeding pigs with food waste. But China is also intent on minimising the crisis. With new-year cooks busy planning pork-heavy feasts, China’s agriculture ministry assured the public on January 16th that ASF is having a “limited impact” on markets. 
Dirk Pfeiffer, a vet and infectious-diseases expert at City University of Hong Kong, credits China with working hard to contain ASF. He notes that even rich European countries struggle with it. Still, he worries about why China’s outbreaks are scattered as dots across the map rather than in clusters, as might be expected. This suggests either that the disease is being controlled with unusual success, or that outbreaks are being underreported. 
Whether swine fever smoulders or blazes across China’s farm-country, it has already exposed the striking political weakness and isolation of the country’s small farmers. In Europe, where farmers wield outsize political clout, the spread of ASF is blamed on government bungling, bringing calls for ministerial resignations. From Romania to Poland, Belgium and Estonia, pig farmers demanding compensation and stricter controls on wild boar have variously obstructed government vets, blocked motorways with tractors and threatened to dump animal dung on parliament. Governments have hastened to appease them. “I am one of you,” a Polish minister told protesters pleadingly, citing his pig-farming past. To reassure farmers, Denmark is building a fence to stop wild boar crossing from Germany. On January 25th France said that it would mobilise troops to kill wild pigs. European farmers are used to deference. They often enjoy geographically concentrated voting power. Voters see them as defenders of cherished traditions. Tractors are a handy prop: governments fear sending riot police to attack anything that routinely appears in children’s books. 
Chinese breeders mount protests, too, for instance when corrupt officials steal land. But though ASF threatens many with financial calamity, this is not causing visible unrest. In part that is because the government works to stop citizens from banding together. And when it comes to public opinion, Chinese farmers are often on their own. Chaguan visited a farmer surnamed He, in the coastal province of Fujian. The 57-year-old grumbles about “hassle” from health inspectors. “We’re not that afraid of swine fever, we’re afraid the government’s management is getting too strict,” Mr He says, hosing manure from pens holding about 150 pigs. His three-year-old grandson scampers nearby, bells tinkling on ankle bracelets. Mr He makes a profit of up to 30 yuan ($4.46) per kilo on his pigs, not enough to pay for biosecurity measures ordered by officials. He sees no end to the ASF crisis. “Doesn’t seem like there’s much we can do.” He is not puzzled that his children do not want his farm: the government “subsidises big farms, not small ones”. 
A bleak truth lurks in “What is Peppa?”. Many Chinese feel for that film’s hero, rattling around his half-empty village. They also understand why such places are abandoned. Tellingly, the trailer’s emotional climax involves the grandfather relishing the big city with his family. For many small farmers in this country in a hurry, swine fever will hasten an end that was already in sight.
