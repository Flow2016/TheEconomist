Your article on the history of childhood (Special report on childhood, January 5th) was based almost entirely on the work of Philippe Ariès, whom you cited. But though we are indebted to Ariès for beginning serious scholarship on this topic, his central thesis that childhood did not exist before the 17th century is now discredited. Notions of childhood existed throughout history. Across time and different cultures, childhood has been viewed as a distinct stage of life, and children have had cultural activities and possessions of their own. 
It is simply untrue that children were viewed primarily as imperfect adults and that the stark separation of adults and children is a modern invention. It is also not true that parents did not love and cherish their children, even at a time of high infant mortality. They took part in rituals around their children’s birth and grieved their death. The way children were viewed historically was extremely diverse, a point missed by Ariès. It is not helpful to assert that childhood did not exist before the 17th century.

Childhood seems to be losing its fun. Earlier and earlier schooling, shifting family patterns, increased time spent indoors and in cities, and constant technological evolution have created socioeconomic pressures. Your special report neatly identified four childhood revolutions from medieval times to the present day, but did not acknowledge today’s play crisis. Neuroscientific research shows that playtime is critical to developing the cognitive, creative and communications skills needed in the future, and yet time set aside for play is being squeezed everywhere. 
University College London is leading research on this issue on our behalf. Its findings, to be shared later in 2019, will identify “play gaps” in more than 40 countries. Closing these gaps in access to play will support deeper learning, which science tells us is when learning is joyful, experimental, social, meaningful, hands-on and minds-on.

As a researcher in the field of internet addiction, I am grateful for the balanced position you took on the effects of digital-media overuse on children’s mental health. That said, I wondered why you did not mention that the World Health Organisation has included the diagnosis “gaming disorder” in the latest draft of its classification of diseases? I am aware that scientists are still debating whether this diagnosis is premature, but you should have raised it to provide the full picture.

American pre-eminence in science and technology has a straightforward heritage. Astonishing experiences during the second world war, such as the Manhattan Project, the effects of advanced radar and so on, convinced many that America must embark on a nationally planned programme of scientific research. The momentum of this thinking took us through the cold war and space race and has underpinned America’s unchallenged array of research universities and national laboratories. But now we seem to have lost our mojo, highlighted by the National Academy of Science’s report, “Rising Above the Gathering Storm”. Federal funding and science support is lagging just when rivals like China are making real advances (“Red moon rising”, January 12th). 
The seminal role of science is lacking in our national political dialogue and this is where we must make the definitive break with China. As a professional scientist, I cannot see a path for China to maintain the level of original thinking that it needs while pursuing authoritarian control in almost all other spheres. America’s founders understood this. Science played a trenchant role in forging our democracy.

Recall that the spread of scientific inquiry under Denis Diderot, Jean d’Alembert, and other figures of the 18th-century Enlightenment helped undermine support for absolutist rule in France and contributed to the end of the monarchy. Science and absolutism are uncomfortable bedfellows. 
MICHAEL MERTAUGHPortland, Maine 
I suppose it was only to be expected that an anti-Brexit, London-based weekly would want to have a giggle about Tim Martin’s free-trade tour around a hundred of his pubs (“Me and my Spoons”, January 19th). Why so snide? Mr Martin founded, runs and presides over the fortunes of nearly 1,000 pubs and hotels throughout Britain, offering wholesome food and a wonderful variety of draught beers at cheap prices. The business generates a healthy annual profit and the man is obviously a minor commercial genius. I would have thought that a newspaper supportive of free trade and hard-headed business efficiency would have wanted to sing his praises rather than treat him and his achievements as eccentric. 
Down here on Costa Geriatrica, some of us long ago concluded that no British institution did more to ease the economic and human pain of living through the austerity years than Wetherspoons.

The article on Disney’s live-action remakes put me in mind of Cecil Beard, one of the early Disney cartoonists, whom I knew in his retirement years (“An old new world”, January 5th). Authenticity mattered in his day, too. Cecil told me how, when making the original “Bambi”, he and three other cartoonists went out in the Sierras and filmed wild animals. They then broke down the films, frame by frame, to learn how the animals really moved. As well as enhancing the credibility of their animation, the work of those cartoonists turned out to be original research, making its way into physiology textbooks.

Regarding corruption in Chicago (“On the make by the lake”, January 12th), in the late 1960s Mike Royko, a Pulitzer prize-winning columnist for several newspapers, suggested that the city change its motto to “Where’s Mine?”
