# A deceptive tweet casts doubt on the Indian government’s credibility 
##### Some say it is also understating unemployment and overstating economic growth

NOTHING HURRIES governments more than an approaching election. But sometimes, as Piyush Goyal, India’s minister of railways, recently found, haste can cause accidents. Keen to tout the Vande Bharat Express, a fast new service, he posted a clip that showed the made-in-India train roaring through a station at a blinding pace. As eagle-eyed viewers swiftly noted, however, the film had been altered to run at double speed. Jokesters quickly counter-posted a cascade of mockingly accelerated footage, including a lightning-fast bullock cart zooming along a dirt track. 
With a general election looming in April it is not just pictures, but dreary statistics that the government has been accused of doctoring. Indian opposition parties have often charged their rivals in power with massaging official data. But since the landslide victory of Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014, critics claim, the practice has become commonplace. 
In January two of the five members of the body that vets official statistics resigned in protest, after the government blocked release of what many consider the most accurate indicator of unemployment. The numbers were soon leaked, and to no one’s surprise they showed an embarrassing rise, to a 45-year high of 6.1%. 
Other numbers have also sown suspicion. Soon after taking office Mr Modi’s government announced it would revise the official method of calculating GDP and rebase the data to a new year. Frequently since then, economists have puzzled over numbers that consistently show stronger growth than seems justified by other indicators. They also seem strangely impervious to obvious shocks, such as Mr Modi’s banning in 2016 of all currency bills worth more than 100 rupees ($1.41), or the imposition of a stiff sales tax with no fewer than seven separate rates and laborious forms for businesses to fill in. 
In November, after an inexplicable three-year delay, the government’s number-wallahs released a new back series for GDP growth according to the new methodology. To some surprise, considering that the noughties are recalled as an era of unprecedented boom, the new statistics showed Mr Modi’s government smartly outperforming its predecessor. 
Sceptics abound, as do theories of how and how far the government’s numbers stray from the truth. Some blame flawed adjustments for inflation. Arun Kumar, an economist, argues that the government’s estimates of the growth of the informal economy, which accounts for nine in ten jobs and perhaps 45% of GDP, presume too strong a correlation with the formal economy. Mr Kumar argues that it is quite possible for the easily measured, tax-paying part of the economy to be growing by 7%, even as the less perceptible poor are quietly suffering. Taking into account such drags as Mr Modi’s “demonetisation”, the shrinking of credit and a prolonged and continuing slump in farm prices, Mr Kumar suspects that the informal economy may in fact be contracting—something that would substantially reduce overall growth. 
Mr Kumar may be off the mark; even neutral outfits such as the IMF and rating agencies share Mr Modi’s numerology. But the government’s credibility keeps taking knocks. On February 1st Mr Goyal, as acting finance minister, released a budget that promised lavish handouts while purporting to hold the deficit to 3.4% of GDP. Many observers said he was pulling a fast one.
