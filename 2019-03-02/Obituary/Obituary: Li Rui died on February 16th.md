THE SUMMONS was one Li Rui could not ignore. Nor did he want to. When Mao Zedong sent a plane to fetch him to their first private meeting, in 1958, he was 41 and rising fast. His position as deputy head of the Ministry of Water Resources made him the youngest vice-minister in the still-young Chinese republic. Even better, he was the first director of Joint Factory 718, an electronics venture with East Germany that employed 10,000 workers, offered furnished living quarters, sports teams, a hospital and an orchestra, and was bound for success. 
All the same, doubts niggled. His last effort to join Mao had turned sour. After his hard, keen trek on foot at the end of the 1930s from his home province, Hunan, to Yanan, Mao’s rebel stronghold, he had started writing editorials in the revolutionary newspaper Liberation. But these were so spikily revealing about both sides (“Rui” meant “sharp”, and he lived up to that) that he was thrown in prison as a spy, needing “rectification”. His mother had told him tearfully, as he left home, “The Communists are good, but you might get killed.” Or, apparently, trashed by his own side. 
Now Mao was ruler, and he was being called to discuss the Three Gorges Dam, a giant power project proposed for the Yangzi river. He and Mao did not agree about it. As a trained engineer, he fiercely opposed it, whereas Mao in a poem had already imagined himself swimming in its shadow, admiring its “walls of stone” and “smooth lake rising”. Oddly, though, Mao liked the way he argued; seemed to like him too, despite, as a peasant, loathing intellectuals; and asked him to be his secretary for industrial affairs. 
It lasted barely a year. Mao brooked no dissent, insisting on controlling everybody’s minds; he often claimed to be a terrifying blend of Marx and the first Qin emperor, a brutal unifying warlord of ancient times. Since his new secretary was the straight-talking sort, he was soon purged for daring to criticise openly the Great Leap Forward, the economic enormity which led China into savage famine. After that, he was in jail and exile in the northern mountains for the best part of 20 years. But that brief closeness to the chain-smoking Great Helmsman gave him insights that seared him. It also gave him enough standing in the party, when times were calmer, to barrack other leaders continually to leave Maoist methods alone. For as long as the party kept flirting with autocracy, where government, leader and ideology made one unchecked force, China would never reform or truly advance. 
Eventually he wrote five books on Mao, from birth to death, turning himself into a valued historian of those years. Yet the point of history was to learn from it and face up to it, and the party would not. Each leader, from more open-minded Deng Xiaoping onwards, was battered with his opinions and demands. They were drafted in his centre of operations, a study in which it was impossible to cram any more books, and from which he angrily shooed away anyone who filmed what he was writing. Sometimes they took the form of open letters, sometimes interjections at Communist Party congresses. He spoke out even against Tiananmen, that unmentionable massacre, stating simply but emphatically that the students were right and the leadership was wrong. As “the veteran liberal member”, he was usually met with silence, sometimes humoured, and ignored. He harassed Xi Jinping over dinner when the future leader was just party secretary in Zhejiang, a poorly educated hack in his view, not a patch on his admirable father. He was horrified to see how autocratic the man became, once in power. 
His political wishlist was not long. First, free speech: the party had to listen to the people. Second, freedom to publish. He had been a proper investigative journalist, as well as a trenchant writer; but his Mao books were banned on the mainland, and the journal Yanhuang Chunqiu, which he strongly backed in its unofficial reappraisals of Chinese history, had been made anodyne and the editor sacked. Top of the list, he sought constitutional and democratic governance, with the party reframed as a socialist party in the west European style. That thought was so subversive, so unChinese, that in 2013 it was officially, though secretly, condemned. But a man who had got through nine years of solitary by running on the spot, practising qigong and writing 400 poems, in gentian violet, in the margins of Marx’s collected works would not be cowed by that. True to his name, he stayed thorn-sharp. 
All the same, what could be done with China’s Communist Party, and what would it become? The question was on his lips even in his last days, which were spent in a first-rate hospital reserved for party officials. For he had never left the party, or even toyed with that. It was his life, ever since he had joined it secretly, at 20, in 1937; ever since, as a student, he had been jailed by the Kuomintang for eagerly thrusting Marxist textbooks into people’s hands. Mao had expelled him and, in the name of the party, destroyed his first marriage and almost killed him; but that groupthink party of red books and red scarves was not the one he had raced to as a patriotic young rebel, urgent to rid China of warlords and invading Japanese. When he was readmitted under Deng in the 1980s he hoped for a party of brotherhood and social justice, but of freedom too. Instead, as he wrote in a poem, he found arrogance, ignorance, shamelessness, lawlessness. He wore red—as he wore his loyalty—but he had also grown to loathe it. Everything was red, red, red. 
Red was naturally the colour of the flag that was to drape his coffin once he was inside it. That, as well as burial at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing, was his privilege as a senior party member. Asked whether he wanted that, he merely said he would prefer to be buried with his parents in Hunan. He felt bad that he had not cared for his mother in her old age. It made him sigh to recall those simple words of hers, “The Communists are good.” 
When his funeral took place, everything was as the party wanted. No media were allowed. Mr Xi, rid of his most vexing thorn, sent a nice wreath of flowers.
