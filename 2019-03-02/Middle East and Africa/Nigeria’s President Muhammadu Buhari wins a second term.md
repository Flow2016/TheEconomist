> Feb 28th 2019 
A  SMALL CROWD gathered around a plastic table by a dusty roadside in the eastern Nigerian town of Yola on February 23rd. When an electoral officer announced that Muhammadu Buhari, the incumbent president, won the most votes there his supporters in the crowd erupted, cheering and dancing. Fans of his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar, who cast his ballot at this polling station earlier in the morning, slunk away, dejected. “It feels very painful,” said Muhammad Sanusi, one such supporter. 
That pain has only increased. On February 27th Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced that Mr Buhari had won a second term, with 56% of the vote. His victory this time will not generate the same euphoria it did in 2015. The former general, who ruled briefly as the country’s military dictator after a coup in the 1980s, has struggled to fulfil many of the campaign promises he made four years ago. Mr Abubakar’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) claims the results were rigged. In a sign of growing voter apathy, turnout, which languished at 44% in 2015, fell to 36% this time. 
For many Nigerians, the election has been tarnished by the sloppiness with which it was run. The vote was originally scheduled for February 16th, but INEC postponed it just hours before it was meant to begin because it had been unable to get materials, such as ballot papers, to polling stations on time. When the vote was held at last on February 23rd, observers say most polling stations opened hours late for the same reason, and many election officials were unprepared. The European Union’s observer mission cited “serious operational shortcomings”. 
Voting proceeded peacefully in most parts of the country, but violence broke out in some states. The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, a group of NGOs monitoring the vote, reckons at least 39 people were killed over the weekend, most by thugs who attacked polling stations. It is not clear on which party’s behalf they were acting. Some fear clashes after the poll, a staple of previous Nigerian elections. About 800 people were killed in 2011. This time, to deter such violence, radio stations in Yola played only songs promoting peace on voting day. “No need to fight-o,” one number urged. “Things gotta change by determination; this election no intimidation.” 
Vote-buying was more widespread. Mr Buhari’s All Progressives’ Congress (APC) and the PDP were probably both culpable. In a posh neighbourhood of Lagos, Nigeria’s economic capital, one resident says he saw a man handing out cash on voting day. On the eve of the vote, a journalist in Yola said a politician gave his wife sachets of spices to give to voters in her village.

Such problems have also plagued past elections, and observers say this vote was not necessarily worse run. YIAGA Africa, an NGO, carried out a parallel vote tabulation (PVT), a technique for projecting results based on a sample of polling stations in each state. It says the PVT’s estimates “are consistent with the official results announced by INEC”. 
The PDP, though, says the APC plotted to rig the vote with help from the army and INEC. “I hereby reject the result,” Mr Abubakar declared shortly after his defeat was announced. His party alleges that Mr Buhari’s replacement of the Supreme Court’s chief justice in January, ostensibly for corruption, was in fact aimed at thwarting a legal challenge to the results. Mr Abubakar has said the PDP will mount one. The court-appointed election tribunal could take months to issue a verdict. That said, the courts have never overturned a presidential election in Nigeria. 
Many Nigerians will be disappointed to see Mr Buhari remain in power. Broadly, his campaign this time focused on the same three areas as it did in 2015: corruption, the economy and security. Progress on all three has been limited on his watch. 
“I was very disappointed with Buhari’s first term,” says Umar, a civil servant in Abuja, the capital. But he says he “had to vote for him in the end” because he believed Mr Abubakar was corrupt. Graft remains ever-present in the lives of most Nigerians, and opponents accuse Mr Buhari of fighting it selectively. His own party has welcomed light-fingered defectors from the PDP into its ranks. The APC governor of Kano state, in northern Nigeria, was filmed last year receiving thick stacks of dollars. (He denies receiving the money.) 
Ordinary Nigerians struggle to make ends meet. The economy is still only slowly recovering from a recession in 2016. Some saw it as a chance to diversify, but oil still accounts for over two-thirds of government revenue. Manufacturing is crippled by power shortages. One factory boss in Kano, once an industrial hub, says manufacturers there are producing at around 10% of capacity. Mr Buhari’s supporters say that, given more time, he can do better. 
Security was one area where Mr Buhari appeared to be making progress. The army has pushed the jihadists of Boko Haram out of major towns in the north-east. But they have not been defeated and, in recent months, have looked resurgent. Even more deadly are clashes between farmers and herders in the country’s “middle belt”. Many in the predominantly Christian south accuse Mr Buhari of favouritism towards the country’s largely Muslim northern half. (Mr Buhari is a northern Muslim.) Dire Atako, a Christian timber trader living outside Yola, voted for Mr Abubakar (also a northern Muslim) because he wanted change after his village had been attacked by herders. “The present government assured us of security, but I have seen houses here burned down,” he says. 
At Mr Abubakar’s polling station in Yola, Abdul Mutallib, another of his followers, looked on as APC supporters gloated. “If our candidate loses, we’ll accept it,” he said. “Life goes on.” If the rest of the country’s political class shows the same restraint, then Nigeria’s flawed democracy will have made some progress.
