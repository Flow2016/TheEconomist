TWO YEARS ago ethnic cleansing by the army forced 700,000 Muslim Rohingyas to flee Rakhine state, in western Myanmar, and seek sanctuary across the border in Bangladesh. On August 22nd, outside dismal refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar, buses and lorries lined up for the first of many envisaged repatriations taking Rohingyas back home. But there was a hitch: not a single Rohingya came forward. 
Nor will many change their minds soon. Predominantly Buddhist Myanmar denies citizenship to the persecuted Rohingyas. The word means people from Rakhine, yet the government claims they are not Burmese but “Bengali” impostors. Having been refused formal ID cards, it is impossible for many Rohingyas to prove that they used to live in Myanmar, one of the government’s conditions for repatriation. Besides, what is there to go back to? Their former villages have been razed. Rohingyas who remain in Rakhine now live in camps, too. 
The plight of the Rohingyas has gained notoriety, though with compassion for refugees at an international ebb, they could be stuck in the camps for years. The risk is that youngsters will be radicalised by a (so far) tiny Rohingya group committed to armed insurgency. 
Would that the displacement of the Rohingyas was Myanmar’s only source of ethnic conflict. Even in Rakhine state a far more violent insurgency is being fought by a group which claims to have little in common with the central government apart from a shared hatred for Rohingyas. The Arakan Army (AA) is fighting to defend the interests of the Buddhist Rakhine (the ethnic group that gave the state its name) in a country so often run on behalf of its Burman majority. This year the AA has launched attacks on police posts, killing their occupants and making off with weapons. The armed forces have responded with ground offensives and even warplanes. The conflict has entered towns and cut important roads and waterways. Few international aid groups are allowed into northern Rakhine to help civilians. For months the authorities have imposed an information blackout by shutting down the internet. 
As for the unruly states of Kachin in the north and Shan in the north-east, where ethnic insurgencies have rumbled on for decades, last December the army chief, General Min Aung Hlaing, declared a temporary “ceasefire for eternal peace”. If it was a gambit to deal with the Rakhine insurgency, it has miscarried. In August a bunch of insurgent groups calling itself the Northern Alliance Brotherhood launched bold and bloody attacks on police posts and bridges in Shan state and even an elite military academy in Myanmar’s heartland near Mandalay. Among the groups taking part was the AA, operating far from its home base. 
The lessons for a “peace process” that has become an industry, sucking in millions of dollars from international donors and involving no end of foreign experts, are not salutary. The efforts of the country’s putative leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, have been undermined both by the army and by distrust among ethnic groups of her National League for Democracy. Meanwhile, the army’s own Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement of 2015 excludes the biggest militias. Years of broken promises to ethnic groups have not helped. 
It is a hugely complex mosaic. Ethnic groups with grievances towards an overweening army and state live in overlapping territories. Ethnicities and identities often commingle and change, a process spurred by social media, migration and urbanisation. The economic rackets in both army- and rebel-held areas are predatory and extractive, involving drugs, jade, timber and human-trafficking. The dynamics, as Thant Myint-U, a historian, has put it, are less like Syria today than Chicago in 1926. 
Persuading Myanmar’s myriad ethnic groups to lay down arms with promises of equitable development will be fiendishly hard. Yet now comes a new dimension: pressure from China to hasten plans, stretching from Shan state to Rakhine, for a China-Myanmar Economic Corridor of roads, railways, pipelines and a port. China wants an outlet to the Bay of Bengal. It claims the investment will be a boon for Myanmar, incentivising peace and development. Yet the corridor runs right through the country’s most restive—and inequitable—areas. And so the northern group’s August attacks may prove a harbinger. Far from helping extinguish Myanmar’s conflicts, Chinese money may simply spray fuel on the fire.
