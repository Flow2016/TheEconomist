FOR A SEPTUAGENARIAN member of India’s somnolent upper house, five years out of government, Palaniappan Chidambaram is a man much in demand. He served as finance minister in 2004-08 and 2012-14, and as home minister during the interim, in governments led by the Congress party. After Congress was crushed at the polls in 2014 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Narendra Modi, Mr Chidambaram receded from the spotlight. On August 21st, however, an armada of satellite dish-topped TV trucks appeared at his house to watch plainclothes police officers vault over his garden walls and arrest the ex-minister on corruption charges. 
Mr Chidambaram was one of the most powerful men in the country under the previous regime. For a time he was spoken of as a potential prime minister. In office he maintained a stately air even while bashing together backroom deals (much like his successor as finance minister, Arun Jaitley, who died on August 24th). Since his arrest he has been appearing in court almost daily to plead for bail, arguing that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has no cause to keep him in custody. At the same time his legal team is fending off the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which handles financial crimes and wants him on related charges. 
Both agencies claim that Mr Chidambaram and his son, a Congress MP, accepted bribes in exchange for approving foreign investment in a media firm in 2007. They argue that he should stay in jail, although they have yet to present any evidence against him. That is unusual: even accused murderers are sometimes released on bail. His lawyers say the government’s motive is revenge. As home minister, Mr Chidambaram once had the man now in the job, Amit Shah, arrested on charges of murder, extortion and kidnapping. Mr Shah, whose case was eventually dismissed, was refused bail for three months. 
In Paris this week Mr Modi told an admiring crowd of expatriates that his “new India” is combating corruption like never before. Three days later the tax authority sacked 22 career bureaucrats who faced pending charges. A prime justification for Mr Modi’s decision to revoke the special autonomy enjoyed by the state of Jammu & Kashmir on August 5th was that corruption in its political class had made reform impossible. Hundreds of Kashmiri politicians and activists have since been locked up. 
Estranged allies of the BJP have come under the cosh, too, including two prominent figures in Hindu nationalist politics in the state of Maharashtra. But the Congress party has received the most attention. The CBI just arrested a nephew of Kamal Nath, the chief minister of the state of Madhya Pradesh, on charges of money-laundering. The ED filed similar charges against two former Congress chief ministers on August 27th. 
Congress is certainly not squeaky clean: a long “season of scams” marred its most recent period in power and was one of the main reasons for its drubbing in 2014. But aggrieved Congress workers point out that the police do not seem to be chasing any current BJP leaders. In several instances, the legal troubles of Congress members seemed to evaporate after they defected to the ruling party. Mr Modi, claims Praveen Chakravarty, a Congress official, is not really interested in stamping out corruption, nor even in persecuting individual politicians. Instead, Mr Chakravarty insists, he is “creating a climate of fear” in an attempt to quell all criticism. 
Mr Chakravarty alleges a second malign motive behind the anti-corruption campaign. He maintains that the government is ginning up a “moral crusade” to distract attention from the ailing economy. Growth has fallen to its lowest level since the Congress party’s last year in office. The current finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has just overhauled her first budget in an apparent panic (see article). But Mr Modi won a second five-year term just months ago. He has plenty of time to repair the economy—and to fight corruption, whether selectively or not. ■
